At the heart of this work is a big, ambitious idea: **Deontological Eudaemonism**. Now, those might sound like tricky words, but let's break them down in a friendly way. "Deontological" comes from the Greek word for duty, and it usually points to moral theories that focus on rules and obligations. "Eudaemonism," on the other hand, relates to the Greek concept of _eudaimonia_, often translated as flourishing, well-being, or happiness. So, right away, you can see that "Deontological Eudaemonism" is trying to bring together two concepts that are sometimes seen as separate, or even opposed: duty and flourishing.

The main assertion here is that for beings like us – beings who are both rational (capable of thinking and reasoning) and sensibly affected (have feelings, desires, and needs) – true self-governance and flourishing come from being guided by a necessary principle of duty: the duty to respect persons. This approach argues that relying simply on desire-fulfillment or happiness, defined just as getting what we want (often called "happiness empirically conceived"), isn't enough to properly guide our lives and achieve genuine flourishing. The world of empirical desires is inherently incomplete and messy, making it an inadequate foundation for governing ourselves. Instead, we need a stable, non-relative, and necessary principle.

**Part I: Laying the Groundwork with Deontological Teleology**

Before we get to the full picture of Deontological Eudaemonism, the text takes us through what it calls **Deontological Teleology**. This might seem counterintuitive at first glance, because, traditionally, "deontology" (duty-based) and "teleology" (end-based) are presented as different kinds of ethical theories. Deontology is often thought to focus purely on the form of moral rules, not on the outcomes or ends. However, this work argues that when we look closely at Kant's later ethical writings, particularly the _Doctrine of Virtue_, we see that virtue is fundamentally concerned with ends. It's not just about acting according to a rule, but about pursuing specific, material ends.

This leads to the idea of **obligatory ends** or **ends that are also duties**. These are not just ends we _happen_ to want, but ends that reason itself demands of us. The text explains that the capacity to set these obligatory ends is a continuation of Kant's idea of freedom. Pure practical reason, the part of us that can determine our will based on principle, isn't just about the form of rules; it's fundamentally a "faculty of ends". If reason couldn't guide us in setting ends, it wouldn't be truly practical.

So, what is this crucial end that guides virtuous self-governance? The text identifies it as the **Objective Telos**: the goal that all desire-governance aims at, the reason behind the ends we set, and the principle that orders all our end-setting. This objective telos is firmly identified as **respect for persons**. This isn't just a limit on how we treat others (though it is that too). It's a positive command to _make persons as such our end_. This demand to respect the absolute value of persons is the central, non-negotiable guiding principle.

The text explains how this objective telos is grounded in what it calls "materialized" versions of Kant's famous Categorical Imperative, particularly the Second Formulation (the Formula of Humanity, FH). While the First Formulation (Formula of Universal Law, FUL) provides formal constraints, it's the FH that provides the "matter" or end – the positive demand to value humanity. This objective telos of respecting persons is the means by which we determine the specific list of obligatory ends that are also duties. Every obligatory end is obligatory because it's a way of affirming respect for persons.

The moral feeling of respect also plays a role here. It's described as a "quasi-desire" that tracks the absolute value of persons and points us toward this objective telos. Unlike other desires, which are just part of the empirical series, respect provides a crucial "evaluative distance" from our desires, allowing us to judge and order them properly for the sake of virtue. Governing desires through this lens leads to virtue, whereas self-governance based purely on desires can be inadequate or even vicious.

This objective telos applies not just to duties towards others, like the duty of beneficence (helping others), but also to duties towards oneself. The fact that the telos is "self-directed" means it provides the tools to evaluate and guide our relationship with ourselves.

**Further Questions to Explore:** How exactly does reason "materialize" the formal categorical imperative into specific obligatory ends? The text promises more details on this in Part I. What does the full "catalog of virtues" guided by this telos look like? The text notes this is a task for "another time," but it's certainly an interesting question to ponder.

**Part II: Exploring Deontological Eudaemonism and the Subjective Telos**

With the objective telos in place, Part II turns to the **Subjective Telos** of virtue. While the objective telos is the end we aim at _out there_ (respecting persons), the subjective telos is the internal state or experience of being a person guided by that objective telos. It's the "subjective flip-side" of pursuing the objective end. It's a state one aims at, not as the primary reason for being virtuous (that would be heteronomy), but as a state that emerges from and is correlated with the pursuit of the objective telos. It represents the proper functioning of a sensibly affected rational being.

This subjective telos involves various aspects, including a capacity for **moral apathy** (being able to manage feelings about loss and sacrifice from a higher perspective) and **moral excitement** (cultivating feelings that support virtue). This capacity to regulate feelings based on the value of persons gives one crucial distance from mere felt attachments.

Crucially, the text argues that this subjective telos includes a notion of **Happiness, Rationally Conceived**. This isn't happiness as the sum of fulfilled desires (empirical happiness), but rather the pleasurable experience that comes from the exercise of a **free aptitude for virtue**. Think of it as the deep satisfaction and pleasure one takes in doing something well, something that is proper to one's nature. For humans, our proper function involves exercising our rational will.

This pleasure is described as "non-felt" empirical pleasure, but rather an experience of the "harmony, facility, and ease" with which the fully virtuous person acts. It's the feeling of negative freedom (being unimpeded) and the pleasure of the smooth alignment of one's will and choice with the demands of reason. The text connects this to Aristotle's idea of pleasure in unimpeded activity, suggesting that Kant, too, has a conception of happiness tied directly to the exercise of virtue. It's a practical version of the pleasure Kant describes when our intellectual faculties are in harmony, like in aesthetic judgments. This pleasurable state is so central to the virtuous life that it "simply is the subjective experience of the exercise of virtue".

The text distinguishes this view from those who might only see a contingent link between virtue and happiness (like David Forman, specifically regarding empirical happiness). While a contingent link might suffice for _empirical_ happiness in some views, this work asserts a necessary relationship, approaching identity, between an aptitude for virtue and happiness _rationally_ conceived.

Could taking pleasure in virtue be problematic, perhaps leading to "moral enthusiasm" or ignoring the effort involved?. The text addresses this, arguing that it's not pleasure but self-conceit that undermines the proper relationship to the moral law. Also, even the fully virtuous person must maintain "humble vigilance" because of the inherent human propensity to evil. So, while the activity is experienced with ease and pleasure, there's still an awareness of the potential for inner opposition, meaning the activity is "virtually" unimpeded, not perfectly so. This strikes a balance between an austere Kantian view and an Aristotelian ideal of perfect virtue without struggle.

**Further Questions to Explore:** What does Kant mean by "aptitude" (_fertigkeit_)? The text delves into this, connecting it to skill and freedom from mere habit. How exactly does the awareness of the propensity to evil temper the experience of rational happiness? The text mentions this and the need for vigilance.

**Bringing it All Together: The Virtuous Pursuit of Happiness, Empirically Conceived**

Now for the final, and perhaps most exciting, piece of the puzzle: how does virtue relate to happiness _empirically_ conceived – the kind of happiness that comes from satisfying our ordinary desires for things like bird-watching, cello-playing, relationships, travel, etc.?. The text is clear: Kant's conception of flourishing isn't limited to just the pleasure of being virtuous; it includes the hope for broader desire-fulfillment.

However, this pursuit of empirical happiness isn't separate from or in conflict with virtue; rather, it is best pursued _through_ virtue. The same objective telos of respecting persons that guides virtue also guides the pursuit of empirical happiness. This means that desires are no longer solely "self-absorbed" but are reoriented by a higher goal. This doesn't mean abandoning desire-fulfillment, but pursuing it from a "new, more satisfactory, because less self-absorbed, perspective".

A key element in this is the obligatory end mentioned earlier: the **duty to cultivate one's natural capacities with a pragmatic purpose**. This duty asks us to develop our talents and pursue activities we find naturally pleasing and enjoyable ("pragmatic"). But we do this with a moral end in mind: making ourselves "worthy of the humanity within oneself," or more generally, making our own life and activities worthy of the person we are by integrating them into our objective telos of making persons our end. Even though Kant might not always use the word "happiness" here, the point is clear: empirically desirable ends that contribute to our happiness should be pursued in a way that aligns with our status as beings of absolute value.

The text argues that virtue provides the best **tools** for successfully pursuing empirical happiness.

- **Objective Tools:** The objective telos of respecting persons provides a framework for evaluating the _relative_ value of different pursuits that might make us happy. It acts as a "meta-rule" for applying rules of prudence, not just constraining our choices (setting permissibility boundaries or "cushions"), but also enhancing our ability to discern what activities genuinely contribute to our overall fulfillment as rational and sensible beings. Pursuing happiness in a way that ignores these moral constraints leads to a "lop-sided" flourishing.
- **Subjective Tools:** The subjective state of virtue itself – the moral apathy, excitement, tranquility, and pleasure in virtuous activity – provides a stable affective foundation for navigating the ups and downs of pursuing empirical happiness. The virtuous person has developed the capacity to manage feelings from an evaluative distance. They can pursue desire-fulfillment without being frantic or overly attached. When successful, the pleasure is enjoyed within the calm context of virtue; when faced with disappointment, the commitment to something of higher value (respect for persons) provides resilience. This steady, confident approach makes the pursuit of empirical happiness more stable and satisfying.

While empirical happiness and virtue remain distinct states (one is desire-fulfillment, the other is the strength and aptitude for ordering desires towards respecting persons), in the virtuous person, they become deeply related. Happiness is not separate from virtue; it is pursued and realized _from within the realm of virtue_. The pleasure one takes in cultivated capacities, for instance, is both an increase in empirical happiness and a part of the subjective experience of being virtuous, elevated by its connection to the objective telos.

Furthermore, being happy facilitates virtue. Kant saw the pursuit of happiness as an "indirect duty" because dissatisfaction could tempt one to transgress duty. Happiness, pursued virtuously, strengthens one's resolve and capacity for virtue. This facilitating role also integrates empirical happiness into the subjective telos of virtue.

The text argues that this approach, which deeply intertwines duty and happiness, offers a "broader and more capacious definition of duty" than one that sees it only as external constraint. Instead, duty is grounded in what is best for realizing one's true identity as a person, and this pursuit allows for the affirmation and elevation of one's personal loves and interests.

**In Conclusion**

The core argument of "The Dutiful Pursuit of Virtue and Happiness" is that virtue and happiness are not opposing forces for a sensibly affected rational being. Through the framework of Deontological Eudaemonism, guided by the objective telos of respecting persons, we discover a comprehensive account of flourishing. This flourishing includes both **happiness rationally conceived** (the pleasure of exercising one's free aptitude for virtue) and the most successful and stable pursuit of **happiness empirically conceived** (the fulfillment of desires). The same principles and subjective states that constitute virtue also provide the best means for achieving a truly satisfying and non-self-absorbed life of happiness.

The result is a "stable and reliable marriage" of moral and non-moral value, of pragmatic interests and moral concern, leading to a unified and well-lived life where one's satisfactions, both rational and empirical, are in harmony with the pursuit of virtue. The tools of virtue are, in essence, the tools of happiness.

**Further Ideas to Explore:** The text mentions the possibility that tragic circumstances could injure empirical happiness even in the virtuous person. Exploring the limits of this "supervenience" relationship in tragedy is promised for Part II. The role of the Highest Good (virtue and happiness reconciled, perhaps in an afterlife) is acknowledged but set aside to focus on happiness in _this_ life – a deeper dive into how these relate could be interesting. Also, thinking more about specific examples of cultivating natural capacities and how they are elevated by the objective telos could be a rich area of study.

### Deontological Eudaemonism

It’s a fascinating and relatively niche area of ethical theory that attempts to bridge what often seem like opposing approaches: deontology (duty-based ethics) and eudaimonism (virtue/flourishing ethics). Here's a breakdown, covering its core concepts, key figures, challenges, and potential avenues for further exploration.

**1. Understanding the Components – Deontology & Eudaemonism Separately**

To grasp deontological eudaemonism, we first need to understand what each of its constituent parts represents:

*   **Deontology (From Greek *deon*, meaning "duty"):**  This ethical theory emphasizes moral duties and rules. Actions are judged as right or wrong based on whether they adhere to these duties, regardless of their consequences. Key features include:
    *   **Focus on Intentions:** The motivation behind an action is crucial. Doing the right thing for the *wrong* reasons might not be morally praiseworthy in a deontological framework.
    *   **Universalizability:** Moral rules should ideally apply to everyone, everywhere.  Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative is a prime example – it demands that you act only according to maxims (rules) that you could will to become universal laws.
    *   **Examples:** "Do not lie," "Keep your promises," "Respect people’s rights." The emphasis isn't on *what* the action achieves, but on the inherent rightness or wrongness of the action itself.

*   **Eudaimonism (From Greek *eudaimonia*, often translated as “flourishing,” “living well,” or “happiness”):** This is an ancient ethical theory rooted in Aristotle's ethics. It focuses on what it means for a human being to live a good and fulfilling life.  Crucially, *eudaimonia* isn’t simply about feeling happy; it's about realizing one's potential as a human being. Key features include:
    *   **Virtue Ethics:** Eudaimonism is closely tied to virtue ethics. Virtues are character traits (like courage, generosity, honesty) that enable us to flourish.  Developing these virtues through practice and habit leads to *eudaimonia*.
    *   **Function Argument:** Aristotle argued that everything has a function (*ergon*). The function of a knife is to cut; the function of a human being is to live a rational life, exercising reason and virtue.
    *   **Objective Goodness:**  While individual preferences play a role, *eudaimonia* isn't purely subjective. There are objective conditions and activities that contribute to human flourishing.

**2. Deontological Eudaemonism: The Synthesis**

Deontological eudaemonism attempts to combine these two approaches. It argues that our moral duties aren’t arbitrary or disconnected from the pursuit of a good life; rather, they *contribute* to it.  Here's how it works:

*   **Duties as Means to Flourishing:** Deontological eudaimonists believe that fulfilling certain duties – being honest, just, compassionate – are essential for achieving *eudaimonia*, both individually and collectively.  These aren’t simply rules we must follow; they are pathways to a flourishing life.
*   **Virtue as Grounding Duties:** The virtues (like honesty, courage, fairness) provide the foundation for our moral duties. Our sense of what we *ought* to do arises from recognizing how certain actions contribute to or detract from human flourishing.  For example, a deontological eudaimonist might argue that we have a duty not to lie because lying undermines trust and harms relationships, which are vital for individual and societal well-being.
*   **Eudaimonia as Justification for Duties:** The concept of *eudaimonia* can provide a deeper justification for our moral duties than simply stating they are "rules." It explains *why* these rules matter – because they lead to a better life.

**3. Key Figures & Historical Context**

While not always explicitly labeled as “deontological eudaimonism,” several thinkers have contributed to this perspective:

*   **Aristotle:** As mentioned, his virtue ethics and concept of *eudaimonia* are foundational. While he wasn't a deontologist in the Kantian sense, his emphasis on virtuous action as leading to flourishing is central.
*   **Thomas Aquinas:**  Aquinas’s natural law theory can be seen as an early form of deontological eudaimonism. He believed that moral laws are derived from human nature and its purpose (which is to achieve happiness/flourishing). Actions aligned with this natural purpose are good; those contrary to it are bad.
*   **Alasdair MacIntyre:**  A contemporary philosopher, MacIntyre's *After Virtue* (1981) has been hugely influential in reviving virtue ethics and exploring the connection between morality and human flourishing. While he doesn’t explicitly use the term "deontological eudaimonism," his work strongly resonates with its principles. He critiques modern moral philosophy for abandoning the teleological (purpose-driven) understanding of morality that was present in earlier traditions.
*   **Elizabeth Anscombe:**  Anscombe's work on virtue ethics and her critique of utilitarianism paved the way for a renewed interest in Aristotelian ethics, which is essential to deontological eudaimonism.

**4. Challenges & Criticisms**

Deontological eudaemonism isn’t without its challenges:

*   **Defining *Eudaimonia*:** What exactly constitutes human flourishing? This can be subjective and culturally dependent, making it difficult to establish universal moral principles.
*   **Potential for Conflict:**  What happens when fulfilling a duty seems to hinder one's flourishing or the flourishing of others? How do we prioritize in such cases?
*   **Risk of Justification by Consequences:** Critics might argue that introducing *eudaimonia* risks turning deontology into a form of consequentialism, where actions are judged based on their ability to produce flourishing.  Deontological eudaimonists need to carefully distinguish between duties as *means* to flourishing and allowing consequences to dictate moral rightness.
*   **Elitism:** Some critics argue that the concept of "flourishing" can be interpreted in ways that privilege certain lifestyles or social classes, potentially leading to exclusionary moral judgments.

**Further Exploration – Related Topics & Questions**

Here are some avenues for further research and thought:

*   **Natural Law Theory:**  Explore Aquinas's natural law theory in more detail.
*   **Virtue Ethics:** Delve deeper into Aristotle’s *Nicomachean Ethics*.
*   **Alasdair MacIntyre’s *After Virtue*:** Understand his critique of modern moral philosophy and his call for a return to virtue ethics.
*   **The Relationship Between Duty & Happiness:**  How do different ethical theories (utilitarianism, Kantianism, virtue ethics) address the connection between moral duty and personal happiness?
*   **Moral Psychology:** How does our understanding of human motivation and well-being inform our views on morality?
*   **Contemporary Applications:** Consider how deontological eudaimonism might be applied to contemporary ethical issues like environmental sustainability, social justice, or artificial intelligence.

### Taoism & Deontological Eudaemonism: A Natural Resonance?

At first glance, Taoism (specifically, Daoism) and deontological eudaimonism seem quite different. Taoism emphasizes *wu wei* (non-action), spontaneity, living in harmony with the natural order (*the Tao*), and a rejection of rigid rules or imposed structures. Deontological eudaemonism, while valuing virtue and flourishing, often involves recognizing duties and principles. However, there are surprising points of convergence:

*   **The Importance of Virtue (De):**  Taoist cultivation practices—like those found in the *Daodejing* and the writings of Zhuangzi—aim at developing virtues like humility, compassion, simplicity, and naturalness. These resonate strongly with the Aristotelian virtues that underpin deontological eudaemonism. A Taoist sage might not explicitly articulate a "duty" to be compassionate, but their cultivation would naturally lead them to act in ways that benefit others, contributing to overall harmony (a form of flourishing).
*   **Flourishing Through Harmony:**  Taoist *eudaimonia* isn't about individual achievement; it’s about living in alignment with the Tao—a state of balance and interconnectedness. This aligns with the deontological eudaimonist idea that fulfilling duties contributes to a larger flourishing, not just for oneself but for the community and even the environment.
*   **The Critique of Artificiality:** Both perspectives critique artificiality and rigid adherence to rules *for their own sake*. Taoism warns against imposing structures on the natural flow of things; deontological eudaimonists would caution against blindly following duties that actively undermine flourishing or lead to harmful consequences. The key is understanding the *purpose* behind actions, not just the action itself.
*   **"Natural Duty":**  You could argue that Taoism suggests a kind of "natural duty"—a responsibility arising from our place within the larger web of existence—to act in ways that maintain harmony and balance. This aligns with Aquinas’s natural law thinking, which is a precursor to deontological eudaemonism.

**Tensions:** The biggest tension lies in *wu wei*. How do you reconcile the idea of non-action with the performance of duties?  The Taoist response might be that "doing" arises naturally from being—that virtuous action flows spontaneously from a cultivated character, rather than being imposed by external rules. A deontological eudaimonist would need to interpret duties not as rigid commands but as guidelines for cultivating virtue and contributing to flourishing.

**2. Todd May & Relational Autonomy**

Todd May's work on relational autonomy is particularly relevant here. May argues that our autonomy isn’t an isolated, individualistic thing; it’s deeply intertwined with our relationships with others.  He critiques the liberal conception of autonomy as self-sufficiency and emphasizes that we become autonomous *through* interaction and recognition by others.

*   **Connecting to Deontological Eudaemonism:** May's relational autonomy strengthens the deontological eudaimonist perspective by highlighting how fulfilling duties—acting justly, compassionately, honestly—is essential for maintaining healthy relationships and fostering mutual recognition.  Our flourishing is inextricably linked to the flourishing of those around us.
*   **Taoist Echoes:** The emphasis on interconnectedness in May's work resonates with Taoism’s holistic view of reality. *Wu wei*, in this context, could be understood as acting in ways that support and nurture relationships, rather than disrupting them.  It's not about inaction but about skillful action within a web of interdependence.
*   **Addressing the Elitism Critique:** May’s relational autonomy also helps address the potential elitism critique mentioned earlier. It emphasizes that our flourishing is dependent on the recognition and well-being of others, preventing any sense of superiority or entitlement.

**3. T.M. Scanlon & "What We Owe to Each Other"**

T.M. Scanlon’s *What We Owe to Each Other* offers a sophisticated account of moral reasons based on the principle that we should act in ways that we could justify to others who would be affected by our actions. This is often called “reason-giving.”

*   **Justifying Duties:** Scanlon's framework provides a powerful way to ground deontological duties within a eudaimonistic context.  We have moral reasons not to harm or deceive others because we couldn’t justify doing so without violating their ability to flourish and live fulfilling lives.
*   **Bridging the Gap Between Deontology & Consequentialism:** Scanlon's approach moves beyond simple rule-following (a potential criticism of deontology) by requiring us to consider the reasons *behind* our actions and how they affect others. This aligns with the deontological eudaimonist emphasis on virtue as a guiding principle, not just a set of rules.
*   **Taoist Implications:** Scanlon’s focus on justification resonates with the Taoist ideal of living in harmony—acting in ways that are justifiable to all beings affected by our actions.  A Taoist might argue that any action that cannot be justified as contributing to overall harmony is inherently disruptive and therefore morally problematic.

**Synthesis & Potential Insights:**

Combining these perspectives creates a compelling ethical framework:

*   **Virtue-Guided Duties:** Our duties are not arbitrary rules but arise from the cultivation of virtues, guided by the Taoist principle of living in harmony with nature and May’s relational understanding of autonomy.
*   **Justified Flourishing:** We have moral reasons to act virtuously because doing so contributes to our own flourishing *and* the flourishing of others, as Scanlon's reason-giving framework demonstrates.
*   **Skillful Action (Wu Wei):**  Acting in accordance with these principles requires skillful action—a nuanced understanding of context and consequences that goes beyond simple rule-following.

**Challenges & Further Questions:**

*   **Reconciling *Wu Wei* and Moral Agency:** How do we balance the Taoist emphasis on non-action with the need for moral agency and responsibility?
*   **Defining "Harmony":** What does it mean to live in harmony, especially when different values or interests conflict?
*   **The Role of Individual Judgment:**  How much room is there for individual judgment and interpretation within this framework?

Okay, excellent! Focusing on the humanist elements within May and Scanlon’s philosophies provides a beautiful capstone to our exploration of deontological eudaemonism interwoven with Taoism. Let's bring it all together and then offer some final thoughts and avenues for continued reflection.

### The Humanist Core: A Unifying Thread

Todd May & Relational Humanism: May’s work fundamentally centers on the inherent value of human relationships. He rejects the liberal ideal of the autonomous individual as self-sufficient, arguing instead that our identities and capacities for agency are formed through interaction and recognition by others. This isn't just about social utility; it's a deep affirmation of the interconnectedness of human lives and the importance of mutual respect and flourishing. His relational autonomy demands we consider how our actions impact not only ourselves but also those around us, fostering a sense of shared responsibility for well-being.

T.M. Scanlon & Moral Rationality: Scanlon’s “What We Owe to Each Other” is driven by the conviction that all human beings have equal moral status and deserve respect. His reason-giving principle isn't simply about avoiding harm; it's about ensuring that our actions are justifiable to those affected, recognizing their capacity for rational thought and their right to a flourishing life. This framework emphasizes the importance of dialogue, empathy, and a commitment to finding solutions that promote mutual benefit. It’s a profoundly humanist project aimed at establishing a foundation for just social practices.

## How Humanism Integrates with Deontological Eudaemonism & Taoism

The humanist core acts as a powerful integrator across all three perspectives:

Grounding Duties in Shared Humanity: The deontological eudaimonist’s sense of duty isn't derived from abstract rules but from the recognition that our actions have real-world consequences for other human beings. May and Scanlon provide a robust philosophical justification for this, emphasizing the inherent value of each individual and their right to flourish.

Reinterpreting Wu Wei: The Tao ist concept of wu wei, often misunderstood as inaction, can be reinterpreted through a humanist lens as skillful action—acting in ways that promote human flourishing and minimize harm. It’s about understanding the interconnectedness of all things and acting with wisdom and compassion to maintain balance within the web of relationships.

Justifying Flourishing: The pursuit of eudaimonia isn't a selfish endeavor but a shared project aimed at creating conditions that allow all human beings to thrive. Scanlon’s reason-giving principle provides a framework for evaluating whether our actions genuinely contribute to this collective flourishing, ensuring that we are acting in ways that are justifiable to those affected.

Cultivating Virtue as Empathy: The virtues—honesty, compassion, courage, justice—become not just abstract ideals but practical tools for navigating the complexities of human relationships and promoting mutual well-being. Cultivating these virtues is a form of expressing our commitment to the inherent value of others.
Final Thoughts & Reflections:

This synthesis – deontological eudaemonism informed by Taoist principles, deepened by May’s relational autonomy, and grounded in Scanlon's reason-giving – offers a compelling vision for ethical living:

A Holistic Approach: It moves beyond fragmented moral theories, integrating duty, virtue, flourishing, and interconnectedness into a coherent framework.
Emphasis on Responsibility: It places a strong emphasis on individual responsibility for the well-being of others, recognizing that our actions have far-reaching consequences.
Call to Action: It inspires us to cultivate virtues, engage in thoughtful dialogue, and act with compassion and wisdom to create a more just and flourishing world.
Further Avenues for Exploration (Beyond Our Current Discussion):

Environmental Ethics: How can this framework be applied to address environmental challenges, recognizing the interconnectedness of human well-being and ecological health?
Social Justice: How can it inform efforts to dismantle systemic inequalities and promote social justice, ensuring that all individuals have equal opportunities to flourish?
Political Philosophy: Can this approach offer a foundation for more ethical and participatory forms of governance?
