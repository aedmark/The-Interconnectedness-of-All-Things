**Introduction:**

Theodore Zeldin's "An Intimate History of Humanity" proposes a departure from conventional historical analysis, focusing instead on the personal, intimate, and often hidden aspects of human experience across vast spans of time and diverse cultures. The author employs individual portraits as a starting point to reveal deeper, often unconscious connections to historical attitudes and struggles. The core method involves exploring the "art of life" through personal narratives, seeking universal themes and shared human experiences that transcend geographical, temporal, and social boundaries. Zeldin emphasizes the idea that the individual mind is a repository of centuries of ideas and that we are often more connected to distant communities and past generations than we realize.

**Main Themes and Key Ideas:**

1. **The Individual as a Lens into History and Humanity:**

	- Zeldin begins each chapter with a personal portrait, suggesting that individual desires, regrets, and behaviors are not solely products of immediate circumstances (family, childhood) but are deeply influenced by inherited attitudes and struggles of past and distant communities.
	- The mind is presented as a complex blend of ideas from different centuries, highlighting the layered nature of human consciousness.
	- _Quote:_ "Each of my chapters begins with the portrait of a living person who has desires and regrets in which you may perhaps recognise something of yourself, but who is also restrained by attitudes inherited from origins long forgotten. The mind is a refuge for ideas dating from many different centuries..."

2. **The Pursuit of Independence and Self-Definition:**

	- Several individual portraits highlight the struggle for independence and self-definition, often against societal expectations or challenging personal circumstances.
	- Juliette uses her cheque book as a "passport" to prove her independence, demonstrating a shift towards more controlled spending as a sign of stability.
	- Lydie seeks to escape the "commonplace" through public service and proves women can do security work, emphasizing competence without necessarily challenging male dominance.
	- Maya achieves independence by taking responsibility for her own problems and focusing on self-improvement, seeking freedom from material attachment.
	- The Renaissance is linked to a "rebellion by women" that led to the invention of a new ideal of polite, gentle, and cultured behavior, shifting the focus from power and reputation to sociability and conversation, as exemplified by Madame de Rambouillet.
	- The idea of the independent individual is not solely European; thinkers in various countries have meditated on loneliness and uniqueness.
	- _Quote:_ "It makes for happiness to be what you can, when you cannot be what you would.’ That was the first assertion of the difficulty that individuals have in putting on a conformist exterior." (Referring to a Renaissance figure)
	- _Quote:_ "The Romantics claimed that each individual combines human attributes in a unique way, and that one should aim at expressing one’s uniqueness in one’s manner of living, just like an artist expressing himself in his creative act."
	- Fashion is presented as a potential, though often failed, means of expressing individuality.

3. **Loneliness, Connection, and Friendship:**

	- Loneliness is a recurring theme, explored through individual experiences (Maya's solitude, Absa's missing African family life) and historical contexts.
	- Historical responses to loneliness range from ascetic withdrawal (St. Anthony) to the pursuit of social connection.
	- The text explores the difficulties and nuances of friendship, including the Maya concept of _camarada_ (intense, often fraught male friendships), the challenges of trust, and the historical limitations on friendship (Aristotle's view, Greek competitiveness).
	- The possibility and challenges of friendship between men and women are explored, with historical examples of customs that allowed for closeness without sexual expectation (bundling).
	- Modern aspirations for mixed friendships are seen as a key area for development in both private and public life.
	- _Quote:_ "Being alone seemed to be a cure [for demons/worries]."
	- _Quote:_ "The moral the old man [a Mayan descendant] drew was, ‘One cannot and should not trust another person all the way.’"
	- _Quote:_ "If friends have to be identical, then men and women must despair of being friends."
	- _Quote:_ "A loving friendship (amitié amoureuse) is indeed a new form of art, as interesting as a companionate marriage."

4. **The Complex Nature of Human Relationships, Particularly Between the Sexes:**

	- The excerpts delve into the evolving dynamics between men and women, highlighting historical shifts in expectations, power structures, and expressions of intimacy.

	- Historical examples of intimate relationships, from Renaissance courtiers to 18th-century bundling, illustrate diverse forms of connection and the changing meaning of "making love" or "intimacy."
	- The difficulty of achieving genuine understanding between the sexes is noted in various contexts (Madame Martineau's daughter's view of boys, Mauricette's perspective on men's emotions, Sir Richard Burton's failure to understand women despite his scholarship).
	- Modern relationships are seen as moving beyond traditional roles, with young women prioritizing "relationships" and intimacy over solely focusing on marriage.
	- The excerpts mention historical views on homosexuality, tracing its evolution from a ritualistic or social practice to a medical classification, and highlighting the diverse forms it has taken across cultures and time.

5. **Hunger, Taste, and Pleasure as Cultural and Personal Expressions:**

	- The role of food and taste goes beyond mere sustenance, serving as a lens into cultural identity, historical change, and personal desires.
	- Staple foods and their associated sauces or spices have historically divided and defined civilizations.

	- _Quote:_ "Every people puts its own scent on its food, and it accepts change only if it can conceal the change from itself, by smothering each novelty in its scent."
	- _Quote:_ "Sugar... has indeed united the world’s taste more than anything else. Once a rare and divine medicine... it is the culinary expression of democracy."

6. **The Search for Escape and Adventure:**

	- Escape is presented as a fundamental human desire, whether literal travel (Ibn Battuta's journeys, Vivienne's father's limited travel) or metaphorical (Lydie seeking the "out of the ordinary," the gambling company as an "escape factory," Michéle Blondel's art as an investigation of escape).
	- Travelers like Ibn Battuta and Sir Richard Burton demonstrate different motivations and limitations in their explorations of the world.

	- _Quote:_ "He [Gandhi] believed that in order to be tolerant an ordinary person needed first to acquire enough personal strength, and that meant fearlessness."
	- The Indonesian approach to Islam is presented as a historical example of successful tolerance and integration of diverse traditions.

8. **The Ever-Changing Nature of Society and the Persistence of Old Ideas:**

	- Despite apparent progress and societal shifts, older attitudes and ideas persist, often unconsciously influencing behavior.
	- Astrology's resurgence during the Industrial Revolution and its appeal across social and political divides illustrate how old beliefs can re-emerge in new contexts, particularly in times of uncertainty.
	- The difficulty of making decisions and the feeling of being subject to fate are enduring human challenges.
	- _Quote:_ "It is easy to assume, when suffering from indecision, that one has something wrong with one, so there is a Parisian astrologer, formerly a philosophy teacher, who treats her clients as ‘patients’, and says their disease is that they have not grown up..."
	- _Quote:_ "Today, the words used to say this [that fate rules the world] may have changed, but the idea remains."

	- Hospitality served to integrate strangers into communities, even if temporarily (Lithuanian "clansman," Albanian protection).
	- The lavish hospitality of figures like King Guaire and the Chinese government's prioritization of entertaining guests highlight its social and even political significance.
	- The Swat Pukhtun's dream of a foreign friend on whom they can lavish hospitality contrasts with their internal conflicts.
