### Overview and Context

Carol Gilligan's book "In a Human Voice" emerges from a significant re-evaluation of her earlier, groundbreaking work, "In a Different Voice," which marks its 40th anniversary, while the initial essay that sparked it was published 45 years ago. The shift in title from "In a Different Voice" to "In a Human Voice" represents a crucial insight Gilligan came to over several years: the "voice of care ethics" is fundamentally a human voice, and labeling this human voice as "feminine" is problematic. Her latest work is driven by the realization that the gender binary—the division of human capabilities into "masculine" or "feminine"—is not only a distortion of reality but also a fundamental pillar of patriarchy.

Gilligan’s journey into these insights began in the early 1990s, prompted by new research and shifts in the socio-political climate. She observed the difference between _having_ a voice and actually _being heard_, noting that while people may silence their voices, they never truly lose them; there is always a reason behind such silencing. This core concept challenges the ingrained idea that finding one's voice alone solves problems, emphasizing instead the crucial act of being listened to and taken seriously.

### The Genesis of "A Different Voice": Challenging Kohlberg

The roots of Gilligan's ideas are deeply intertwined with her work as an assistant to the renowned psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg. Kohlberg’s influential six-stage theory of moral development, which became a standard in psychology, posited that individuals progress from self-centered motives through interpersonal connection to actions based on principles. However, Kohlberg observed that most people didn’t reach the highest stages, often getting "stuck" at the "law and order" fourth stage.

Gilligan, in her seminal 1982 book "In a Different Voice," critically questioned Kohlberg's schema. She noticed that his tests frequently placed girls and young women at lower stages of moral development than boys and young men, often clustering around the third stage. Gilligan speculated that the issue wasn’t women's moral immaturity, but rather that Kohlberg's scale was presented as _the_ universal scale, failing to acknowledge other paths of moral evolution. She argued that for women, the kind of interpersonal connection Kohlberg described as a mid-level stage was, in fact, the very foundation of a distinct way of understanding moral relationships—as relationships themselves, rather than abstract principles.

Gilligan proposed her own three levels:

1. **Pre-conventional:** Self-interested, similar to Kohlberg’s initial stage.
2. **Conventional:** Characterized by caring for others, often at one's own expense, an "other-directed morality" founded on actual relationships.
3. **Post-conventional:** Integrates care for both self and others, aiming for a balance. According to Gilligan, the highest level of moral development integrates both ethics of care and justice.

Her work was considered a "shattering" critique of Kohlberg’s approach and was recognized as a "disruption" upon its initial publication, quickly becoming a citation classic. The abortion decision study, where she listened to women discuss their choices, was the central impetus and focus of "In a Different Voice".

### The Core Message of "In a Human Voice": A Universal Ethic of Care

The evolution to "In a Human Voice" signifies a crucial theoretical clarification: the "different voice" of care ethics is a fundamentally _human_ voice. Gilligan realized the "trap" she had inadvertently set for herself by linking difference with women in her initial titles, leading to questions about whether women are inherently different, whether she was an essentialist, and whether race and class were as important as sex or gender. Her goal was to challenge the very binary comparisons and hierarchies that her work was sometimes interpreted through.

The ultimate message of her research, therefore, is not about women _per se_, but "about what it means to be human". Girls' voices, she found, hold a key because of their ability to articulate both their resistance and accommodation to patriarchal ideologies. The surprising discovery was "how much people know, and how accessible the under-voice is, once you question the cover".

Key themes and insights in "In a Human Voice" and related discussions include:

- **Connectedness vs. Separateness**: Moral problems are often constructed from an assumption of connectedness, rather than the separateness often implied in traditional moral frameworks.
- **Concern for Hurting**: A predominant theme in women’s responses to moral questions is a concern about causing harm, a wish not to hurt others, and the hope that morality can resolve conflicts without injury.
- **Vulnerability**: Women often experience a sense of vulnerability that can prevent them from taking a firm stand, linked to their lack of power and inability "to do something in the world".
- **Ethical Epistemology**: Laugier, a philosopher reflecting on Gilligan, argues that the "different voice" is crucial for bringing women's voices into "ordinary human conversation" and reveals that moral philosophy, at its heart, has historically been a patriarchal form of thought. Gilligan's work promotes an "ethics of attention" and provides a starting point for an "epistemology of ethics".
- **Knowing as Relationship**: The concept of identity expands to include interconnection, and the moral domain enlarges with responsibility and care in relationships. This shifts the underlying epistemology from a Greek ideal of knowledge (correspondence between mind and form) to a "Biblical conception of knowing as a process of human relationship".
- **Critique of Totalitarianism**: Gilligan writes that "the enemy of freedom is not structure but totalitarianism, which sets out systematically to destroy freedom, co-opting voice and confusing language".
- **The "Under-Voice"**: People have deep inner knowledge and feelings, an "under-voice," that can be accessed by carefully questioning the "cover" or the superficial responses they might offer. The ability to articulate personal "I" messages, or what Gilligan calls the "I Poem," is key to reassessing life and overcoming depression.
- **Dangerous Words**: The words "no" and "why" have historically been dangerous for women in many cultures, with their suppression being central to their initiation into patriarchy. Similarly, for boys, initiation often involves a "sacrifice of relationship" and a relinquishing of closeness with female caregivers, leading to objectification of the "other".
- **Direct Communication**: Gilligan’s work underscores the importance of direct, open-ended questions that allow individuals to express their true feelings and thoughts, contrasting with conversations where one might ask "what I think" versus "what I _really_ think".

### Connections and Broader Influence

Gilligan’s ideas have resonated widely and influenced various fields:

- **Feminist Theory**: Her work is deeply rooted in feminist philosophy and challenges traditional gender roles, encouraging a focus on women's experiences and moral perspectives. While some feminist philosophers using Gilligan's work explore motherhood, Simone de Beauvoir's work offers a different model, analyzing extramarital relationships and critiquing men's oppression of women, thus challenging essentialist readings of gender difference.
- **Literature and Storytelling**: Ursula K. Le Guin, a celebrated author, has openly recommended Gilligan's work as "one of the most useful guides into the difficult area of the cultural determination and enforcement of differences between male and female moral perception". Le Guin's own literary development, particularly her "conscious feminist" writing through physical experience and understanding of conversational patterns, was informed by Gilligan's theories. Le Guin also distinguishes between "mother tongue" (language of belief, connection, relationship) and "father tongue" (language of authority, doubt), aspiring to a "language of human truth" that integrates these, echoing Gilligan's holistic vision.
- **Communication and Empathy**: Gilligan's emphasis on listening attentively and engaging in a "conversation with the storyteller" aligns with broader principles of effective communication and empathy. The concept of "experiential sharing" through attuned mirroring of feelings, as discussed in empathy research, highlights that understanding is not just about knowledge but also about feeling. This echoes the "naked voice" in voicework, which emerges from one's innermost being and fosters shared speaking-listening experiences.
- **Psychology and Development**: Her work provided an early and significant challenge to the prevailing male-centric models of psychological development, advocating for a more inclusive understanding of human moral maturation.
- **Methodology**: Gilligan's approach is qualitative, relying on interviews to uncover the nuances of how individuals, particularly women, conceptualize morality and themselves. This contrasts with more quantitative, principle-based assessments.

### Limitations and Ongoing Dialogue

While immensely influential, Gilligan’s work has also faced scrutiny. Some of its methodology and assumptions are considered "culturally limited". Ironically, despite her intention to challenge binary comparisons and hierarchies, her work was often viewed through that very lens, leading to debates about whether she was an essentialist. The feminist movement itself sometimes focused on "more-radical-than-thouism," which may have overshadowed integrative traditions within feminist theory and practice, including some of Gilligan's more nuanced points.

"In a Human Voice" serves as a powerful reminder that the ethical journey is deeply personal, relational, and intertwined with our capacity to truly hear and acknowledge the diverse voices within ourselves and others, free from the constraints of rigid binaries or patriarchal structures. It advocates for an ethic where responsibility, care, and interconnectedness are central to what it means to be human.
