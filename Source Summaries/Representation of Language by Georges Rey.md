Georges Rey's "Representation of Language: Philosophical Issues in a Chomskyan Linguistics" (2020) offers an in-depth exploration and defense of foundational issues within Chomskyan linguistic theory, particularly focusing on the contentious role of intentionality and representation. The book is not intended as a general textbook on Chomskyan linguistics but rather as a rigorous philosophical engagement with its underlying assumptions and implications. Critics have praised it as an "excellent introduction to the foundations of generative linguistics" and a "sustained contemporary engagement with the many philosophical nuances of Chomsky’s own position," offering "sharp observations and original ideas". It is considered "vital reading for anyone interested in Chomsky’s revolution in linguistics and what it has meant for our understanding of the human mind".

### Book Structure and Core Ideas

Rey's work is divided into three main parts:

1. **Part I: The Core Chomskyan Views** provides an exposition and defense of Chomsky's foundational linguistic concepts. This section discusses crucial data that supports the grammar, distinguishing it from unacceptability responses that might be due to other cognitive systems like memory or rapid parsing. It also examines the speed, stability, and universality of grammatical competence acquisition in children, and its independence from other cognitive functions. A significant part of this involves detailing the distinction between _I-language_ (internal, intensional, individualistic biological systems in the brain) and _E-language_ (external, social phenomena like "English" or "Swahili"), which Rey loosely interprets as a mixed system of I-language and social rules.
2. **Part II: The Core Philosophical Views** delves into the philosophical claims surrounding Chomskyan theory, including nativism and the concept of "representational pretense".
3. **Part III: Intentionality** is the most "contentious discussion," addressing whether and how Chomskyan theory is committed to intentionality and the problematic notion of "representation". This section concludes with a critical discussion of Chomsky's views on the mind-body problem.

### The Centrality of Intentionality and Representation

A primary argument throughout Rey's book, especially in Part III, is that intentionality is not only relevant but "needed in the specific explanatory projects Chomskyans have in mind". This challenges Chomsky's more recent public dismissals of intentionality from serious science, a stance Rey finds puzzling and akin to "methodological dualism".

Rey's argument for intentionality is built on several key points:

- **Intentional Inexistents (SLEs)**: Rey proposes a "startling proposal" for understanding Structural Linguistic Entities (SLEs)—such as phonemes, words, phrases, and sentences—as "intentional inexistents". This concept, borrowed cautiously from Brentano, suggests that these entities are "objects" of mental representation that "simply are not real" in the external world. This allows linguistic representations to be "of" or "about" something (e.g., a "noun phrase") without necessitating an external, physically instantiated referent, thereby addressing one of Chomsky's concerns about representations being "of" actual external things.
- **Explanatory Adequacy**: Rey argues that intentionality is crucial for Chomskyan linguistics to achieve "explanatory adequacy," which aims to explain how children acquire language. For instance, a child's perceptual system must be "sensitive to grammatical phenomena" and engage in "probabilistic reasoning" to move from sensory input to grammatical understanding. This process, Rey contends, requires "computations being defined on intentionalistic representations of the linguistic categories". Without intentional content, it becomes difficult to explain how the grammar and the parser can "communicate with each other, sharing, as it were, a common coin".
- **Critique of Chomsky's Anti-Intentionalism**: Rey highlights what he sees as "egregious examples of use/mention confusions" in Chomsky's own writings. He points out instances where Chomsky and others incorrectly describe linguistic "features" as "describing" or being "enclosed in square brackets," when it is actually the _names_ or _representations_ of these features that behave this way. Rey also questions Chomsky's re-positioning of phonetic/phonological features as mere "instructions for articulatory gestures" in the brain, arguing that "instructions had better represent and normally cause the relevant parts...to respond," rather than being identical to the actions themselves. This reflects a more general challenge to "reductionism" that seeks to define intentional notions in non-intentional terms, a "demand [that] has been oddly inappropriate" given the immaturity of psychological theories.
- **Computational-Representational Theories (CRTs)**: Rey suggests that CRTs, comprising computational and representational parts, can offer a clearer account of the "knowledge" and "cognizing" that Chomsky refers to. While Chomsky himself has expressed doubts about CRTs as a general theory of thought, Rey argues that they can explain how grammars are acquired through mechanical procedures and how "structural representations produced by those processes are then available for further (one hopes!) computationally characterized processes of comprehension and production".
- **BasicAsymmetries**: To address challenges from empiricist critiques like Quine's and Fodor's, Rey introduces "BasicAsymmetries" as a modest approach to defining intentional content. This concept helps explain how a physical system can be sensitive to "abstruse properties"—like "being a noun"—that are not local, physical, or always instantiated in the world, allowing intentionality to play an "essential explanatory role" without requiring a full reduction to physical terms.

### Connections and Broader Implications

Rey's work engages with a broad philosophical landscape, linking Chomskyan linguistics to:

- **Frege's Philosophy of Language**: Rey's discussion connects to Frege's aim for a "concept-script" (Begriffsschrift) as a precise "formula language of pure thought modeled upon the formula language of arithmetic," which sought to replace the ambiguities of ordinary language for specific purposes like mathematical reasoning. Both Frege and, according to Rey, Chomsky, are seen as wishing to "break the power of the word over the human mind".
- **The Mind-Body Problem**: The book explicitly aims to shed light on Chomsky's views regarding this problem, suggesting that Chomsky's core linguistics, especially when understood intentionalistically, offers welcome insights.
- **The "Poverty of the Stimulus"**: Rey's analysis advances the discussion by differentiating between empirical problems and indeterminacy arguments, posing a deep challenge to empiricist accounts by asking how children infer grammaticality (a modal attribute) from mere statistical observations.
- **Behaviorism and Empiricism**: The book underscores the historical wariness towards notions of meaning and mind, influenced by extensional approaches to logic and mathematics and the skepticism of behaviorists like Quine. Rey provides a reply to Quine's challenge regarding the psychological reality of grammars and the distinction of linguistic facts from behavioral dispositions.
- **Philosophical Method**: Rey advocates for "Explanation First" as a guiding principle, prioritizing scientific explanation over "commonsense" metaphysics.

Overall, Rey's "Representation of Language" is a comprehensive and provocative work that robustly defends key aspects of Chomskyan linguistics while arguing for the indispensable role of intentionality, particularly through the concept of "intentional inexistents," in providing a full explanatory account of language and cognition.
