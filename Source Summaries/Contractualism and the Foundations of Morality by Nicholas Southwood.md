Stepping into the intricate world of moral philosophy, Nicholas Southwood's "Contractualism and the Foundations of Morality" embarks on a compelling quest. This insightful work aims to dissect and ultimately resolve what Southwood identifies as the core challenge of moral philosophy: pinpointing the ultimate grounds of morality itself. Far from a dry academic exercise, this book offers a fresh perspective on how we understand our moral obligations and why they hold sway over us.

Let's break down Southwood's comprehensive analysis:

### The Essence of Morality and Its Foundations

Southwood begins by clarifying what he means by "morality" and its "foundations". For him, morality encompasses the complete set of facts about actions that are morally permissible, impermissible, and obligatory. To properly evaluate any theory seeking to ground morality, he suggests we must understand its two fundamental dimensions:

1. **Intensional Character:** This refers to the core meaning and understanding of moral terms and concepts. Think of widely accepted "platitudes" that define what we mean by "morally required." For instance, Immanuel Kant famously argued that moral requirements are "categorical," meaning they apply universally and unconditionally. If someone claimed a "non-categorical moral duty," Kant would suggest a conceptual confusion. This dimension explores what these terms fundamentally _mean_.
2. **Extensional Character:** This concerns the actual actions that fall into the categories of permissible, impermissible, or obligatory. It's about agreeing on which specific acts belong to which set. For example, most would agree that defending oneself during a physical attack is morally permissible, intentionally harming innocent civilians is impermissible, and saving drowning toddlers is obligatory.

Crucially, an account of morality's foundations must offer an **ultimate explanation** for these moral facts, reaching what Southwood calls "explanatory rock-bottom". This isn't just a surface-level description; it's about uncovering what _makes_ something morally right or wrong, and why. Southwood places this inquiry within the realm of "philosophical ethics," a term Stephen Darwall uses to describe a type of moral inquiry that transcends the modern bifurcation of meta-ethics and normative ethics.

### Evaluating Moral Theories: Southwood's Two Core Criteria

To determine whether a moral theory successfully establishes the foundations of morality, Southwood proposes two key criteria:

1. **The Moral Accuracy Criterion:** A theory must be faithful to both the intensional and extensional characters of moral facts.
    - **For Intensional Character:** It needs to account for morality's distinctive **normativity** (why we _necessarily_ have reasons to act morally, its inherent authority, and its "other-regardingness") and its **objectivity** (the idea that moral truths are not merely subjective preferences).
    - **For Extensional Character:** It must align with our considered judgments about **morality's partiality** (allowing for special concern for ourselves, friends, and family) and **morality's impartiality** (recognizing the moral standing of all sane adult humans, implying universal rights and duties).
2. **The Explanatory Adequacy Criterion:** Beyond simply being accurate, the theory must provide a genuinely appropriate explanation. This means it must avoid being:
    - **Explanatorily backwards:** Getting the order of explanation wrong.
    - **Explanatorily superseded:** A better, more fundamental explanation exists.
    - **Explanatorily epiphenomenal:** The theory's central elements are merely inert by-products of other, more fundamental considerations.
    - **Explanatorily circular:** Illicitly assuming what it's supposed to explain.
    - **Explanatorily non-fundamental:** Presupposing considerations that are _more_ explanatorily fundamental.

### A Critical Look at Existing Contractualist Models

Southwood then turns his critical eye to two prominent contractualist traditions:

#### 1. Hobbesian Contractualism (exemplified by David Gauthier)

This approach suggests that morality arises from rational self-interested agreements, where individuals cooperate because it ultimately benefits them. It often appeals to practical reason to explain both the need for and the possibility of morality. The strength here is its normatively modest starting point, making it seem well-positioned to satisfy the explanatory adequacy criterion.

However, Southwood argues it falls short on **moral accuracy** due to its "implausibly personal and subjective conception of the moral point of view".

- **Normativity Objection:** While it might explain _why_ individuals have _some_ reasons to act morally (e.g., to avoid negative consequences), it struggles to account for the _distinctive authority and other-regardingness_ of moral reasons. For Hobbesians, even seemingly other-directed desires are still fundamentally _an agent's desires_, making it hard to express genuine expectations on behalf of others. Guilt and compensation, for instance, would appear as strategic moves rather than genuine moral responses.
- **Impartiality Objection:** Hobbesian contractualism fails to establish the moral standing of the "Truly Powerless" (those who cannot offer benefits or impose harm). Their rights become contingent on others' care, not inherent. This approach implies that some individuals are _de facto_ entitled to do anything to others, flagrantly violating core judgments about morality's impartiality.

#### 2. Kantian Contractualism (exemplified by T.M. Scanlon)

This model, rooted in Kant's ethical works, posits that moral principles are those that individuals would agree to from a common standpoint, driven by mutual respect among free and equal persons. Scanlon's version, in particular, focuses on what principles "no one could reasonably reject" as a basis for informed, unforced general agreement.

Southwood contends that even if this approach is **morally accurate**, it fails the **explanatory adequacy** criterion.

- **Circularity Objection:** The core concept of "reasonableness" in Scanlon's theory appears to be "virtually devoid of independent non-moral content". When determining what reasons are "reasonable" to reject a principle, the judgment often seems to already incorporate moral content, thus presupposing what the theory is meant to explain. It's like building morality into the definition of "reasonableness" from the start.
- **Non-Fundamentality Objection:** Scanlon's contractualism, at best, is "explanatorily non-fundamental". It appears to track or presuppose "contract-independent reasons" – normative considerations that are prior to and independent of the hypothetical agreement process itself. The contractors' verdicts are determined _by_ these more fundamental reasons, making the contractual apparatus parasitic rather than foundational.

### Southwood's Deliberative Contractualism: A New Path

Acknowledging the limitations of existing models, Southwood proposes his own innovative framework: **deliberative contractualism**.

#### The Core Idea

This theory posits that morality's foundations lie in "facts about what common code we would agree to live by if we were perfectly deliberatively rational". This shifts the focus from self-interest or a pre-defined notion of reasonableness to an ongoing process of ideal deliberation.

#### The Interpersonal Point of View

Deliberative contractualism characterizes a unique "interpersonal point of view". This isn't just a subjective personal view, nor is it a detached, impartial stance. Instead, it sees individuals as active participants in a shared process, recognizing others not merely as objects of claims, but as fellow authors of the moral rules that govern everyone. It entails understanding and being understood from distinct personal standpoints.

#### Deliberative Rationality and Normativity

At its heart is the concept of **deliberative rationality**, which involves open communication, discourse, and reflection with all affected parties, guided by specific deliberative norms (communicative, discursive, and reflective). These norms are not morality in disguise; rather, they are the intrinsic presuppositions of deliberation itself.

The normativity of this approach is explained by **relational formalism**. This means that deliberative contractualist agreements provide reasons that are normative expressions of "deliberative citizenship" – a morally significant relationship that arises from our shared capacity for deliberative agency. These reasons are not derived from other values; they are "other-regarding all the way down," meaning they inherently express authority and accountability between distinct persons.

#### Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs:** Deliberation can draw upon the full spectrum of an individual's "first-personal standpoints," including their normative judgments (even moral ones). This avoids circularity because individuals are deciding on a common code, not necessarily knowing they are _establishing_ morality itself.
- **Outputs:** The result is a "common code to live by". This is understood as a "two-level moral theory," meaning it aims to establish general principles rather than prescribing every specific act. These principles are assumed to attract "partial compliance," acknowledging the complexities of real-world application, and leave room for individual judgment and discretion.

#### Inclusion

A critical aspect is the "democratic criterion for inclusion". This means anyone affected by the moral principles should be included in their determination. This ensures that arbitrary differences like race, gender, or wealth don't exclude individuals from moral standing, unlike Hobbesian contractualism. It provides a basis for universal inclusion, combating moral relativism, and ensures that moral duties involve a non-trivial reference to those to whom duties are owed. Importantly, this criterion isn't an arbitrary stipulation but flows directly from the nature of deliberative rationality itself.

### The Promise of Deliberative Contractualism: Accuracy and Adequacy

Southwood argues that deliberative contractualism holds significant promise in meeting both the moral accuracy and explanatory adequacy criteria.

#### Moral Accuracy

- **Normativity:** It accounts for morality's "minimal normativity" (agents necessarily have reasons to act morally) through reasons of deliberative citizenship. The "bindingness" of moral reasons comes from this relational aspect – one is bound by them simply by virtue of this relation, which transcends assertions of independence or community membership. It also captures the "other-regardingness" effectively, as reasons of deliberative citizenship inherently involve authority and accountability between persons.
- **Objectivity:** While not "eternal and immutable" in a rigid sense, it implies a kind of "universality" through the agreement on a common code and "non-arbitrariness" because reasons are justified through deliberation. It also ensures "epistemic accessibility" of moral facts through various forms of actual deliberation (informal, institutional, democratic politics).
- **Partiality and Impartiality:** The theory is expected to produce a common code that allows for agent-relative prerogatives (e.g., special care for loved ones) within reasonable limits. For impartiality, its "interpersonal interpretation of the moral point of view" naturally accounts for universal patiential rights and agent-relative restrictions, as others are taken seriously as individuals with authority. It also provides a framework for understanding duties of aid and duties to "atypical persons" (e.g., severely mentally disabled, non-human animals), ensuring they have a voice in moral considerations, even if their status differs from typical deliberative agents.

#### Explanatory Adequacy

Southwood meticulously defends his model against the five forms of explanatory inadequacy:

- **Against Backwardness:** He argues that deliberative contractualism is _not_ explanatorily backwards. The validity of principles arises _from_ their agreement within the deliberative contractual situation, and this isn't arbitrary because the conditions of deliberative rationality provide the necessary grounding. The framework explains what needs explaining without recourse to a prior, external validation.
- **Against Superseded/Epiphenomenal:** Southwood differentiates between types of explanations. While first-order explanations (e.g., "genocidal murder is wrong") are valid, deliberative contractualism provides a higher-order explanation for _why_ such actions are wrong and _why_ we have reasons to avoid them, including morality's distinctive normativity. The contractual apparatus is not a mere inert by-product; it's essential for grounding morality as conceived by the theory.
- **Against Circularity:** Although the deliberative norms might seem to echo moral values (e.g., sincerity, respect, fairness), Southwood asserts they are fundamental presuppositions of _deliberation itself_, not illicitly smuggled moral content. He finds the circularity objection uncompelling.
- **Against Non-Fundamentality:** Unlike Kantian contractualism, deliberative contractualism is designed to be explanatorily fundamental. Its reasons are not _tracking_ prior, more fundamental contract-independent considerations. Instead, reasons of deliberative citizenship are themselves foundational, arising directly from our deliberative agency. While the question of why deliberative contractualism itself constitutes "explanatory rock-bottom" is acknowledged as a deep philosophical challenge, Southwood argues that its ability to accurately account for morality's character strengthens its claim to fundamentality.

### Conclusion

Southwood concludes that while Hobbesian contractualism gets morality "wrong in the right way" (explanatory adequate but morally inaccurate) and Kantian contractualism gets morality "right in the wrong way" (morally accurate but explanatorily inadequate), his deliberative contractualism offers a promising "third possibility." It presents a unique model that endeavors to be both morally accurate and explanatorily adequate, offering a robust account of morality's foundations by centering on the agreements of perfectly deliberatively rational agents. This approach, despite requiring further elaboration on specific moral duties and the acquisition of moral knowledge, carves out a significant space for itself in contemporary moral philosophy.

This deep dive into Southwood's "Contractualism and the Foundations of Morality" truly showcases the sophisticated ways philosophers grapple with the very essence of right and wrong. It’s an intellectual journey that encourages us to not just follow moral rules, but to understand their deepest roots.
