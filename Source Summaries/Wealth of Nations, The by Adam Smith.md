**What's the Big Idea? The Source of Wealth!**

Right from the start, Smith gets down to business, asking what actually makes a nation wealthy. It might seem simple, but people had some rather different ideas back then, like believing wealth was just about how much gold and silver a country had. Smith, however, argues that the true source of a nation's wealth isn't just a pile of shiny metals. Instead, it's the **annual labour** of the nation. This labour produces everything the nation consumes – all the necessities and conveniences of life. The nation is better supplied if the total amount produced by this labour, or what is bought with it from other nations, is large compared to the number of people who need to consume it. This produce of labour is the _real_ wealth.

In fact, Smith points out that even a workman of the "lowest and poorest order," if they are diligent, can often enjoy a better standard of living – a greater share of life's necessities and conveniences – than even a savage could acquire. This abundance for many, not just a few, is a crucial point.

Want to explore further? You might ask yourself: How has our understanding of a nation's wealth changed since Smith's time? Are there still echoes of the idea that wealth is just about accumulating money?

**Mapping Out the "Wealth of Nations"**

Smith structures his grand inquiry into five main books. The first four books are all about explaining where the revenue of the "great body of the people" comes from and what funds supply their annual consumption. The fifth and final book turns its attention to the revenue of the sovereign, or the government.

- **Book 1:** This part dives into the causes behind the improvements in the **productive powers of labour**. It also looks at how the produce of labour is naturally distributed among the different groups of people in society.
- **Book 2:** Here, the focus shifts to the nature of **capital stock**. Smith explains how it's accumulated gradually and how different ways of using it can set different quantities of labour into motion.
- **Books 3 & 4:** These books, along with the first two, cover the revenue sources of the general population. As we'll see, Book 3 delves into how different nations have become opulent at different rates, and Book 4 critically examines different systems of political economy, particularly the prevailing **mercantile system**.
- **Book 5:** This is where Smith discusses the **revenue of the sovereign or commonwealth**. He looks at necessary government expenses, who should pay for them, the different ways taxes can be collected, and the reasons for governments incurring debt and the effects of those debts on the nation's real wealth.

It's quite a comprehensive plan, isn't it? He's not just talking about individual prosperity, but the prosperity of the _entire nation_ and the role of the government within that.

A question to ponder: Why do you think Smith dedicated an entire book just to the revenue of the sovereign? What does that tell us about the relationship between the government and the economy as he saw it?

**The Magic Ingredient: The Division of Labour**

Let's zoom in on that very first topic: the improvement in the productive powers of labour. Smith identifies the **division of labour** as the most significant factor here. It's the key to boosting how much work the same number of people can do.

To understand this better, Smith suggests looking at manufacturing, especially small ones, where the division of tasks is easier to see. While it happens in big industries too, it's often less obvious because the number of workmen in each specialized branch is so large they can't all be seen together. Even in simple tasks, like making nails, the potential for increased output through specialization is enormous. A common smith trying to make nails might only make a few hundred a day, and not very good ones. But a smith whose main job is nail-making could make eight hundred or a thousand. And boys who had _only_ ever made nails could make upwards of two thousand three hundred a day when really applying themselves. The simpler the operation, the greater the potential for dexterity.

Smith explains that this "great increase of the quantity of work" due to the division of labour comes from three main things:

1. **Increased Dexterity:** When a workman does only one simple operation repeatedly, they become incredibly skilled and quick at it.
2. **Saving Time:** Time isn't wasted switching between different tasks, tools, or workplaces.
3. **Invention of Machines:** Focusing on one task makes it easier to see ways to improve it and invent machines that can facilitate or shorten the labour, allowing one person to do the work of many.

Think about it: Instead of one person doing _all_ the steps to make something, many people each do _one_ specific step. This isn't just about speed; it also leads to more skill and makes it easier to invent tools specifically for that one step. This applies to almost every art and manufacture, although agriculture is a bit different because seasonal changes make it harder to keep one person constantly employed in just one task like ploughing or reaping.

This division of labour, and the huge increase in production it enables, leads to what Smith calls **universal opulence** in a well-governed society, extending even to the "lowest ranks of the people". How? Because every workman produces a large surplus of their specific output, far more than they need for themselves. Since every _other_ workman is in the same boat, they can all easily exchange their surplus goods for the surplus goods of others, leading to a general abundance for everyone.

Smith gives a wonderful example by considering the seemingly humble woollen coat of a common day-labourer. He marvels at the "multitude of workmen" whose labour went into creating it: the shepherd, the wool sorter, the dyer, the spinner, the weaver, the fuller, and many others. And it's not just the direct producers; it includes merchants, carriers, ship-builders, sailors, sail-makers, rope-makers (for transporting materials, sometimes from distant lands), and all the labourers needed to produce the _tools_ used by these workmen – from simple shears to complex looms and ships. He extends this to all their clothing, furniture, kitchen utensils, even the glass window that provides light and warmth. Without the "assistance and co-operation of many thousands," he argues, even the most ordinary person in a civilized country couldn't be provided for, despite what we might think is a simple lifestyle. Compared to the luxury of the wealthy, the labourer's life seems simple, but Smith suggests the gap between a European peasant and many an African king might be _less_ than the gap between that peasant and a "naked savage" in terms of accommodation.

Further thought: Does extreme specialization through the division of labour have any downsides today that Smith might not have foreseen? What about the impact on the individual worker? (Smith does touch on this elsewhere in the full book, but it's not prominent in these excerpts).

**The Flip Side: The Limit of the Market**

Here's an interesting twist: while the power to exchange drives the division of labour, the **extent of this division is limited by the extent of the market**. If the market is tiny, there's no point for someone to specialize entirely in one job because they wouldn't be able to sell all their surplus produce that they don't need themselves in exchange for the things they _do_ need.

This is why, Smith observes, country workmen often have to do a variety of related jobs. A country carpenter might also be a joiner, cabinet-maker, wheel-wright, etc., working with all sorts of wood. A country smith does every sort of iron work. In remote areas, like the Highlands of Scotland mentioned in the text, it would be impossible to make a living solely as a nailer, even making a thousand nails a day, because there simply wouldn't be enough local demand (a market) to buy all those nails.

This connection between division of labour and the market size is crucial. As the division of labour becomes "thoroughly established," people can only supply a tiny part of their own needs with their own labour. They must exchange the surplus of their specialized work for the surplus work of others. This makes everyone, to some degree, a merchant, and society becomes, in essence, a **commercial society**.

Ideas to explore: How does the growth of global markets today impact the division of labour? Can you think of examples of extreme specialization enabled by vast global markets?

**Value, Price, and the Role of Money**

So, if we're all exchanging the produce of our specialized labour, how do we figure out what things are worth? What determines their **value**?

Smith grapples with this, especially after the division of labour is widespread. Because your own labour supplies very few of your needs, most things you want you have to get from others. How "rich or poor" you are depends on the quantity of **other people's labour** you can command or purchase.

This leads to a profound idea: **Labour is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities**. What something _really_ costs the person acquiring it is the "toil and trouble" of getting it. What something is _really_ worth to the person who has it and wants to exchange it is the toil and trouble it saves them and imposes on others. Whether you buy something with money or goods, it's purchased by labour – either your own past labour embodied in the money/goods you exchange, or the labour you command from others. Labour was the "first price, the original purchase-money" for everything. The value of wealth, in this sense, is the power it gives you to purchase or command labour or the produce of labour. As Mr. Hobbes said, "Wealth... is power," and Smith elaborates that this power is the power of purchasing, a "command over all the labour... or... the produce of other men's labour, which is then in the market".

While labour is the real measure, we usually talk about **money price**. Money (gold and silver, originally) is the common tool for exchange and the common measure of value. The money price is simply the quantity of pure gold or silver (or paper representing it) the commodity sells for.

It's important to distinguish the **real price** (labour) from the **nominal price** (money price). At the same time and place, money might accurately reflect real value. However, over time or between different places, the value of money itself can change. Half an ounce of silver might command more labour and necessities in Canton, China, than an ounce in London, making a commodity selling for half an ounce in Canton "really dearer" than one selling for an ounce in London, even though the money prices are different. But a merchant moving goods only cares about the _money price_ difference between places because that's where their profit comes from.

This focus on labour as the real value is particularly evident in what Smith calls the "early and rude state of society," before accumulated capital or private land ownership. In such a state, like a nation of hunters, the exchange value of things is simply determined by the relative amounts of labour needed to acquire them – if killing a beaver takes twice the labour of killing a deer, a beaver is worth two deer. In this primitive state, the labourer gets the "whole produce of labour".

Questions this brings up: Does the concept of labour as the "real measure" of value still resonate today, or have other factors become more important in how we think about value? How does inflation complicate the relationship between real and nominal price?

**Breaking Down Price: Rent, Wages, and Profit**

Once society moves beyond that early, rude state, the picture gets a bit more complex. When individuals accumulate **stock** (capital), they start using it to employ others. They provide materials and subsistence (like wages) to workmen, expecting to make a profit from the sale of the finished product or the value added by the labour.

Now, the value added by the workmen resolves into two parts: the **wages** paid to the labourers and the **profit** for the employer who risked their stock. The employer needs the expectation of profit to have any interest in using their stock to employ others. The amount of profit must be proportional to the size of the stock employed. Even an independent workman who owns their own stock (materials, subsistence) and works for themselves receives income that is really a combination of wages for their labour and profit for their stock.

Smith identifies three "component parts" that make up the price of most commodities in a developed society: **wages, profit, and rent** (the revenue from land). In any given place, there's an ordinary or average rate for wages, profit, and rent for different jobs and uses of stock/land. These rates are influenced by the overall state of the society (rich, poor, advancing, etc.) and the specific nature of the employment or land.

The **natural price** of a commodity is the price that is just enough to cover the rent of the land used, the wages of the labour, and the ordinary profits of the stock employed in preparing and bringing it to market. This is the lowest price a dealer is likely to accept for any significant length of time, assuming they are free to change trades if they wish.

The **market price**, however, is the price the commodity actually sells for at any given time. This price is determined by the relationship between the quantity of the commodity brought to market and the **effectual demand** for it. Effectual demand comes from those who are willing and able to pay the natural price (cover the rent, labour, and profit). This is different from mere "absolute demand" – a poor person might _want_ a fancy carriage, but unless they can pay for it, their desire isn't "effectual demand" that brings the carriage to market.

Reflect and ask: How do we see the interplay between natural price (cost of production) and market price (supply and demand) playing out in today's economy? Are there commodities where the market price consistently stays far above or below the natural price?

**Wages, Population, and the Market for Labour**

Smith also delves into what determines the rate of wages and profit. He notes that while wages and profits vary between different jobs, there tends to be a certain proportion between them across employments in a free society. This proportion depends on the nature of the job and the society's laws and policy.

Importantly, Smith argues that in a society where things are left to their "natural course" and people are free to choose and change occupations, the advantages and disadvantages of different employments will tend towards equality. People will flock to more advantageous jobs, increasing competition and lowering those advantages, and leave disadvantageous ones, decreasing competition and raising their appeal, until a balance is reached. However, sometimes what looks like high profit might actually be mostly high wages compensating for risk, trouble, or necessary skills, as in the example of a small grocer whose apparent large percentage profit on a small stock is mostly compensation for his labour and qualifications.

One particularly interesting point is the connection between the demand for labour, wages, and population. The demand for wageworkers increases with the increase in the national wealth (revenue and stock). A growing economy needs more hands. A "liberal reward of labour" (good wages) allows working families to better provide for and raise more children, naturally tending to increase the population of labourers. This population growth responds to the demand for labour. If wages are too low, the population growth needed to meet demand slows; if wages are high, population growth accelerates, which eventually increases the labour supply and brings wages back down to the level the circumstances of the society require. Smith sees this as the market for men regulating their "production" just like any other commodity. He contrasts rapidly growing North America, stable Europe, and stagnant China in this regard.

Consider: Does Smith's view on wages and population seem too simplistic or deterministic from a modern perspective? What other factors influence population growth and labour supply today?

**The Obstacle: Bad Policy and Lack of Liberty**

While advocating for things being left to follow their "natural course", Smith also keenly observes how government policy can interfere and create inequalities. The "policy of Europe" at the time, he notes, did _not_ leave things at perfect liberty, causing significant inequalities.

This interference happens mainly in three ways:

1. **Restraining Competition:** Limiting entry into certain jobs or trades.
2. **Increasing Competition:** Encouraging more people than natural would enter other jobs.
3. **Obstructing Movement:** Making it difficult for labour and stock (capital) to move freely between different jobs and different places.

These policies often stem from flawed ideas about wealth, particularly the **mercantile system**.

Further thinking: Can you think of modern examples of government policies that might unintentionally restrain competition or obstruct the movement of labour or capital?

**Capital: The Fuel for Industry**

Book 2 delves into the nature and role of **capital stock**. For most working people, their stock is just enough to last them a short time, and their income comes from their labour. But accumulated stock is essential for employing labour and increasing productivity.

Smith distinguishes between **fixed capital** (like machinery, buildings, improved land) and **circulating capital** (like money, raw materials, finished goods, provisions for workers). Fixed capital helps increase the "productive powers of labour" – enabling the same number of workers to produce more. Circulating capital is what directly provides the materials and wages, putting industry into motion.

Saving money on maintaining fixed capital, without reducing productivity, is good because it increases the circulating capital available to employ more labour, thus boosting the annual produce of land and labour. This is an improvement to the society's net revenue.

Smith also discusses how institutions like banks and the use of promissory notes (paper money) can increase the amount of industry that can be put in motion. By providing cash accounts and allowing merchants to rely on bank advances rather than keeping large sums of unproductive money on hand, banks enable the same amount of real capital (goods, materials, labour) to support a greater amount of trade and employment. Essentially, banks make the circulating capital more efficient. However, he cautions against excessive issuance of paper money beyond what the real circulation of the country requires, as it can lead to problems. He cites the "Mississippi scheme" led by Mr. Law as an example of the danger of believing paper money could be multiplied to almost any extent.

Interestingly, Smith defends some regulations on banking, like restricting the issuance of small promissory notes, arguing that while they might seem to violate "natural liberty," such regulations are necessary to protect the security of the whole society, just like laws requiring party walls between buildings to prevent fires from spreading.

Curious about capital today? How do modern financial systems and technologies compare to the early banking practices Smith describes in their ability to make capital more efficient?

**Productive vs. Unproductive Labour**

Here's another key distinction Smith makes: **productive labour** adds value to the subject it's applied to and fixes that value in a tangible, vendible commodity that lasts for some time. The labour of a manufacturer is productive because it adds value to the materials and results in a product that can be sold. This added value is enough to replace the wages advanced to the worker and the master's profit.

**Unproductive labour**, on the other hand, does not add such value or fix it in a durable commodity. The labour of a menial servant is the example given – it provides a service that is consumed as it is performed and adds value to nothing that can be sold later. While unproductive labour has value and deserves reward, it doesn't contribute to the accumulation of capital.

A man grows rich by employing productive labour (like manufacturers) because their work creates a surplus value. He grows poor by maintaining unproductive labour (like servants) because their maintenance is consumed without creating something of lasting, exchangeable value. Capital is employed _only_ to maintain productive hands. Revenue (profit or rent) can maintain either productive or unproductive hands.

Increasing the nation's wealth means increasing either the number of productive labourers or their productive powers. Both generally require an increase in capital. Providing better machinery or making a better division of employment among workers requires additional capital. This is why national wealth increases when capital increases.

Points to Ponder: How might we classify different types of labour today using Smith's distinction? Is this distinction still useful in understanding modern economies, where service industries are so prevalent?

**The Natural Path of Progress**

Book 3 considers how different nations become wealthy at different rates. Smith outlines a "natural progress" of opulence: starting with agriculture, then manufactures, and finally foreign commerce.

The primary "great commerce" in a civilized society is between the inhabitants of the town and the country. The country provides food and materials, and the town provides manufactured goods. This is a mutually beneficial exchange enabled by the division of labour; country people can buy manufactured goods with the produce of much less of their own labour than if they made them themselves. The town provides a market for the country's surplus produce, and the larger and wealthier the town, the better the market for the country.

In countries with readily available land, individuals who accumulate stock beyond their immediate needs tend to apply it to land cultivation. Where land is less available, they look to manufacturing for more distant sale, leading to the growth and subdivision of manufactures.

Beyond the purely economic effects, Smith highlights a very important, though less often noticed, consequence of commerce and manufactures: they gradually introduce **order and good government, liberty, and security** among country inhabitants who were previously dependent on great proprietors. Before widespread commerce, a great landowner would consume the surplus produce of their land by directly maintaining a large number of retainers who were dependent on them. With commerce, the landowner can exchange their surplus for manufactured goods and luxuries, allowing them to spend their revenue without directly maintaining many dependants. These goods are produced by many different workmen who, while indirectly supported by the landowner's spending, are not directly dependent on them because they are maintained by contributing a small part to the goods consumed by many different people. This change breaks the power of the great landowners and contributes to the liberty of individuals.

Digging Deeper: How has the relationship between urban and rural areas evolved since Smith's time? Is there still a connection between economic development (like commerce and manufacturing) and the development of political order and individual liberty?

**Critiquing Economic Systems: Mercantilism and the Physiocrats**

Book 4 takes on different systems of political economy. Smith reserves his strongest critique for the **mercantile, or commercial, system**. As mentioned earlier, this system is based on the "popular notion" that wealth consists of money (gold and silver). This idea arises because money is the instrument of commerce (making it easy to buy things) and the measure of value (we use it to estimate wealth).

The goal of the mercantile system, therefore, is to increase the amount of gold and silver in the country, primarily by trying to achieve a positive **balance of trade** – exporting more than importing. Governments try to achieve this through various policies, including restraining imports and encouraging exports, often through specific privileges or monopolies.

Smith argues forcefully that this is fundamentally mistaken. Wealth is not money; it is what money can purchase – the consumable goods annually reproduced by the labour of society. Money is merely an instrument for circulating these goods. While a merchant might need ready money, a nation isn't ruined if it can't constantly exchange its goods for gold and silver. Goods can serve many purposes, but money serves only one: purchasing goods. Thus, money "necessarily runs after goods," while goods don't always or necessarily run after money.

Smith critiques various mercantile policies:

- **Exporting Commodities vs. Gold/Silver:** Merchants naturally prefer exporting goods to pay debts or purchase imports because they make a profit on the sale of the goods they bring back, not just from sending out money. Exporting rude produce (like food) is difficult for carrying on foreign wars because it's bulky and needed for home consumption. Manufactures are much better for this purpose, as only the surplus work is exported, while the workers' maintenance stays home. England's inability to sustain long foreign wars in earlier times wasn't due to a lack of money, but a lack of "finer and more improved manufactures".
- **Bounties and Restrictions:** He criticizes bounties on the exportation of corn, arguing the laws connected to this system are "altogether unmerited". He suggests that England's prosperity is due more to the security the laws provide for individuals to enjoy the fruits of their labour than to mercantilist regulations. He calls these regulations "impertinent obstructions" that hinder the natural effort of individuals to better their condition.
- **Colonial Monopolies:** Smith is particularly critical of the monopolies granted to the mother country over the trade of her colonies. He states that the regulations were designed to secure a monopoly, confining the colonies' market and enlarging the mother country's "at their expense," which tends to "damp and discourage" colonial prosperity. While the colonial trade itself is beneficial, the monopoly is "always and necessarily hurtful". It artificially draws capital into that trade and keeps the rate of profit higher in Britain than it naturally would be, by reducing competition.

He also examines the **agricultural systems**, or **physiocracy**, originating in France. This system posits that the produce of land is the _sole_ or principal source of wealth and revenue. They view agricultural labour as productive because it yields a "net produce" over and above the subsistence of the labourer, while manufacturers and merchants are seen as "unproductive," merely reproducing the funds for their own subsistence. The physiocrats advocate for perfect freedom of trade, believing it raises the value of land produce and encourages agriculture.

Smith respects this system, calling it perhaps the "nearest approximation to the truth" yet published, especially for its understanding that national wealth is consumable goods and that perfect liberty is key to maximizing production. He notes their influence on French policy, leading to reforms like longer lease terms and the removal of internal corn trade restrictions. However, he disagrees with the idea that manufacturing labour is unproductive, arguing that it, like agricultural labour, can augment wealth and its productive powers can be improved through the division of labour and machinery, often to a greater degree than in agriculture.

Points to Discuss: What elements of mercantilist thinking do you still see in economic policies today? How does Smith's critique of trade restrictions relate to modern debates about free trade vs. protectionism?

**The Sovereign's Role: Justice, Defense, and Public Works**

Finally, Book 5 looks at the finances of the government (the sovereign or commonwealth). In his vision of a "system of natural liberty," where individuals are free to pursue their own interests, the sovereign has a limited but crucial role. Smith outlines three primary duties for the government, which are "plain and intelligible to common understandings":

1. **Protecting Society:** Defending the society from violence and invasion by other independent societies. This involves the art of war, which itself becomes a specialized profession in an improved society, requiring the division of labour.
2. **Administering Justice:** Protecting every member of society from injustice or oppression by others within the society. This means establishing and maintaining an exact administration of justice. In early societies, the sovereign's revenue sometimes came from "fees of court" for resolving disputes.
3. **Maintaining Public Works and Institutions:** Erecting and maintaining certain public works and institutions that are beneficial to the society as a whole but which individuals or small groups wouldn't find profitable to build and maintain themselves. The profit from these projects would never repay the expense for a private person, but it can greatly benefit a large society.

Performing these duties requires expense, and expense requires revenue. Smith plans to discuss how these expenses should be covered, the different ways of raising revenue (taxation), their advantages and disadvantages, and the reasons for and effects of public debt. He touches on topics like taxing profit and interest, noting that taxes on profit are difficult to levy directly, while taxes on interest, like rent, should not raise the overall rate if the amount of stock and business remains the same.

He also touches on public institutions like joint-stock companies, often created by the state for specific purposes. He is generally critical of exclusive joint-stock companies for most foreign trade, finding them prone to negligence and mismanagement compared to vigilant private merchants. He notes that such monopolies tax the public through high prices and exclusion from potentially profitable business. However, he sees exceptions for ventures that are simple and reducible to "strict rule and method," like the trade of insurance or building canals and aqueducts, which can be successfully managed by joint-stock companies without monopolies.

Curiosity Corner: How well do modern governments align with Smith's three basic duties? What public works or institutions exist today that fit his description of things individuals wouldn't build but are profitable for society?

**Putting It All Together**

Adam Smith's "Wealth of Nations," based on these excerpts, presents a powerful vision of an economy driven by the productivity of labour, enhanced dramatically by the division of labour. This increased productivity leads to widespread abundance and trade. The value of goods is ultimately related to the labour they represent or command, though money serves as the practical medium and measure of exchange. Price is determined by the costs of labour, profit, and rent, fluctuating in the market based on supply and effectual demand. The system works best when left to its "natural course" with individuals free to pursue their interests, as this tends to balance opportunities and allows the market for labour to respond to the needs of a growing economy. Government intervention, especially in the form of mercantile policies like trade restrictions and monopolies, is often harmful, distorting the natural flow of capital and industry and hindering overall prosperity, even if some effects might seem beneficial to specific groups. The government's essential role is limited to defense, justice, and necessary public works. The accumulation and effective use of capital, facilitated by institutions like banks, are crucial for increasing productive labour and thus national wealth.
