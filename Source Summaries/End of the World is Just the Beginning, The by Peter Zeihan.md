The author, Peter Zeihan, positions his work squarely at the intersection of geopolitics – the study of how place shapes everything about us – and demography – the study of how population structures like age groups influence society. He weaves these two themes together to forecast the future, having explored the "big picture" of the world to come in his previous books. As a geopolitical strategist, his real job involves applying these tools to practical problems for various groups, looking at issues like electricity demand, manufacturing, financial liquidity, security and trade, transport, energy policy, heavy industry, and agriculture. This book, though, goes even further, forecasting the future, or rather, the soon-to-be lack thereof, of global economic structures.

**The Core Idea: The End of a Golden Age**

The central premise is that, geopolitically and demographically speaking, the world has been living in a uniquely perfect moment for the last seventy-five years. This era, which started after World War II, saw the Americans create the greatest military alliance in history, not just to contain the Soviet Union, but also to foster an environment of global security. This security allowed any partner country to go anywhere, anytime, interface with anyone economically, participate in any supply chain, and access any material input without needing a military escort. This "butter side" of the American "guns-and-butter deal" created what we now know as free trade and globalization.

Since 1945, the world has arguably been the best it will ever be. However, according to the author, this era, this world, is doomed. We are rapidly transitioning into a world that will be pricier, worse, and slower because "our world is breaking apart". The 2020s are expected to see a collapse of consumption, production, investment, and trade almost everywhere, with globalization shattering into regional, national, and even smaller pieces. This will be costly, make life slower, and above all, worse, as no currently imagined economic system can function in the future we face. It's expected to be a jarring devolution, a titanic unraveling that humanity won't adapt to easily or quickly after decades of peace built this globalized world.

The post–Cold War era, which many perceive as normal, is actually the most distorted moment in human history, made possible only by a lingering American commitment to a security paradigm that suspends geopolitical competition and subsidizes the global Order. This policy, which no longer matches current needs, is incredibly fragile, and it is over.

**The Tools: Geopolitics and Demography**

The author's analysis consistently relies on his trusty tools of geopolitics and demography. Geopolitics examines how location shapes nations and interactions. Demography looks at population structures and how different age groups behave. He uses these to understand not just how the world ends, but what everything looks like on the other side – the new parameters of the possible and the new Geographies of Success in a deglobalized world.

Demographics, in particular, play a huge role in the coming changes. For example, the world economy isn't just going to shrink, it's being fractured into nonintegrated pieces, partly due to demographic turning points. In 2019, for the first time, there were more people globally aged sixty-five and over than five and under. By 2030, there will be twice as many retirees, in relative terms. This demographic inversion, combined with the end of the global Order, means the old rules don't work anymore, and it will take decades to figure out what might.

The smaller Generation X is insufficient to fill the gap left by retiring Baby Boomers, leading to a larger labor shortage, which gives remaining workers better pricing power but is a disaster for the labor market overall. The generation following Gen X, the Zoomers, are eager workers but are very few in number, being the children of the smaller Gen X generation. There aren't nearly enough Zoomers to round out the labor force for the next two decades, even if they all enter the workforce. Capital availability is also closely tied to demographics, and the mass retirement of the Boomer generation means they are taking their money with them, to the system's detriment in the 2020s. Fewer workers also mean fewer taxpayers and less capital.

Contrast this with specific countries: China's population path turned terminal decades ago, with its labor force and overall population peaking in the 2010s. Projections suggest China's population in 2070 could be less than half of what it was in 2020, with recent data hinting this date could move forward to 2050. China's collapse, in this view, has already begun.

**The Unraveling Across Sectors**

The book maps out how different aspects of our world – food, money, fuel, movement, manufacturing inputs – will change, grow, rearrange, or fail.

- **Transport and Supply Chains:** The globalized world operates as a single economic geography, where processes often cross international borders, sometimes thousands for complex goods. This is becoming relentlessly unwise in a deglobalized world with thousands of different, separate geographies. The whole was stronger for its parts, providing wealth, pace, and speed, but now the parts will be weaker in separation. The modern world, with its specialization and advanced technology, has made us incompetent at tasks that were once essential, like producing our own food or electricity, because we rely on the continuity of systems provided by the Order. A key enabler of modern globalization was containerization. The Order provided the global security, commerce, capital, scale, and reliability needed to build a unified standard for containers, allowing them to move seamlessly through supply chains. This dramatically shrank port turnaround times and costs. By 2019, container ships carried about 50% of global trade by value. These modern container ships hold thousands of containers, often packed with intermediate goods essential for manufacturing. However, long-haul shipping is now expected to degrade from the norm to the exception if the Americans, who provide strategic and tactical overwatch, are removed. The Order worked because the United States had a global navy and everyone agreed not to target ships. That world is gone. With the end of this norm, shooting at or hijacking commercial shipping is expected to make a return, including state piracy. Regions like the Persian Gulf, which relies almost entirely on imports and exports via water, face severe disruption without American patrols. Even with some regional powers attempting to step up, none have the capacity to project naval forces far from their coastlines to enable escort-free cargo trade, except possibly Japan and the United States, and even for them, patrolling wide swaths of the ocean is beyond their capacity. India, with its navy below par but facing no regional peer in the Indian Ocean, might impose "passage" fees on shipments out of the Persian Gulf. Japan is expected to regulate food shipments from the Western Hemisphere to Asia, seeing it as big business and strategic leverage. The Americans themselves are expected to become active agents of disorder, potentially using their navy for aggressive sanctions enforcement.
    
- **Finance:** The current financial world feels deeply unsustainable, and the rules of finance are expected to change again in the 2020s into something we haven't seen before. The modern concept of money, freed from being backed by finite assets like silver or gold, allowed for effectively limitless capital availability, with limitations becoming a purely political question. The Americans expanded the money supply to support the global trading system, while others used the U.S. dollar as a backer to define "limitation" however they saw fit, leading to tools and systems that couldn't exist in the pre-fiat age. A key example is the Asian financial model, originating in Japan's unique view of debt, where capital served political needs rather than economic ones. Debt was used for broad-scale rebuilding and maximizing employment, prioritizing purchasing population loyalty over generating profits. Other Asian states like South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Indonesia adopted this view. China, entering the global Order after the gold standard was gone, knew only the era of fiat currencies and cheap money. China's version led to massive overproduction, prioritizing preventing idle hands over bottom lines. China's model is lending-led, not consumption-led or export-led, making it vulnerable to disruptions in raw material, energy, or export routes. Unlike other Asian states that eventually faced crises and adjustments (Japan in 1989, Indonesia, Korea, Thailand in 1998), the Chinese derivation has no apparent end without collapse. The fiat age allowed economies to paper over problems with cash, putting economic history on hold. Everyone everywhere could be successful as long as the money kept coming. But this era of cheap, easy, omnipresent finance is ending due to fiat failures and the demographic crunch. In a capital-constrained world, funding will favor locations with low-hanging fruit for infrastructure and easier skill maintenance, shifting familiar patterns of economic geography. Projects getting funding will be those that can slim down their employment profile, particularly manufacturing typically outsourced to low-labor-cost areas. Countries not yet in the technology sector may not be able to get involved, and others might lose their foothold, leading to a future where a handful of developed countries are rich and everyone else has nothing. Specific examples of over-credited countries facing corrections include Greece, which saw credit expand sevenfold in seven years before crashing and facing free fall again due to COVID, potentially becoming a ward of another country. India's credit is up tenfold since 2000, making it politically calmer despite other issues, but an epic correction is inevitable. Turkey saw credit increase twelvefold between 2000 and 2013, helping consolidate political control under Erdogan, but the stopping of this expansion, combined with other pressures, has made his rule brittle and authoritarian, even before the inevitable correction. Russia, as of February 2022, was being "melon-scooped" out of global finance due to the Ukraine war, providing a horrific case study of financial disintegration. Russia also faces demographic decline and a system that has given up educating the next generation, with credit collapse being one factor potentially ending the state. China has the largest and most unsustainable credit boom in human history, in absolute and relative terms. China is expected to exit the modern world with a big splash, though the timing is uncertain.
    
- **Energy:** Modern energy, particularly oil, is what separates our contemporary world from the preindustrial one. Many current production and transport systems, like the challenging Kashagan oil deposit in Kazakhstan, were only viable due to the peaceable, stable, and wealthy conditions of the Order. Kashagan and other similar projects are unlikely to survive the end of globalization, potentially removing 40% of global supplies for decades. Once production goes offline in many places, a quick bounceback isn't expected. The bulk of internationally traded crude oil comes from the Persian Gulf, the former Soviet Union, and North America. The Persian Gulf, strategically irrelevant before 1500, became critical under globalization because oil powered trade, which powered the American alliance and security. The region exports oil and natural gas but imports almost everything else, relying on water transport, which is highly vulnerable in a world of collapsed international shipping. While South Asia, East Asia, and Europe will desperately need this oil, local navies are incapable of securing exports, and no foreign power has the capacity to replace the American security blanket, leading to guaranteed chaos and a decades-long global depression. Oil from the former Soviet Union flows primarily towards Europe, but Russia has begun routing some east towards the Pacific. Russian and Kazakh projects are technically exacting and difficult to maintain without outside help. Export via pipelines is vulnerable, as impediments shut down the whole system. Oil is unique because its price is inelastic (small supply/demand changes cause large price swings) and the global market means disruptions anywhere ripple everywhere. In a post-Order world, expected oil prices could be wildly erratic. Some areas might fare better: the United States and Canada, with shale wells that come online quickly, might keep prices relatively stable (around $70/barrel) within their sequestered market. Russia is expected to have sufficient energy for its own needs until the early 2040s, with internal prices dictated by the Kremlin, acting as a closed system. Within the Western Hemisphere, Colombia, Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago are stable producers, and the Americans are expected to ensure maritime security for their transport, potentially even allowing exports to the Eastern Hemisphere as long as no outside power gains strategic foothold. Brazil's significant offshore production faces high costs and technical challenges, requiring substantial foreign investment which might not be available post-Order. Algeria's exports across the Mediterranean may face challenges, potentially being absorbed by France. Factoring out captive supplies and disruptable ones, exportable, reliable supplies globally are estimated at a mere 6 million barrels per day versus a global demand of 97 million. The end of the Order also impacts refineries. Refineries are tailored to specific crude types, but scrambling production and transport patterns will scramble refinery inputs. Many refineries designed for lighter, sweeter crudes (now mostly from US shale) will struggle to access them. Retooling takes time and money, scarce resources in the new world. Climate change is acknowledged, noting that the basic science of heat-trapping gases is well-established. However, the immediate problem is the breakdown of systems. Green technology like batteries faces supply chain issues (e.g., lithium concentrated in Australia, Chile, China, Japan) and requires significant time and capital to rebuild value-added systems elsewhere if East Asia is disrupted. Projects like wind or solar farms involve significant upfront capital costs. In a capital-poor world with rising borrowing costs, these investments become riskier and less attractive compared to conventional systems with lower installation costs. The world is capable of suffering broad economic collapse _and_ vastly increasing carbon emissions simultaneously. A post-globalized world might rely more on readily available, low-quality, high-emission coal as oil and gas supplies become unreliable.
    
- **Industrial Materials:** The Order largely removed geographic constraints on accessing materials, making it a global common good. China became the biggest importer, consumer, and processor of many materials. While the world can survive China's fall, the transition will be painful. Accessing the vast number of materials critical to modern life will be challenging for most countries post-Order, as they are too scattered or too concentrated. Only a few countries with local deposits or global military reach might be able to try, including the UK, France, Turkey, Japan, Russia, and the United States. For the rest, there's a risk of reverting technologically and economically to levels before the Industrial Revolution due to lack of inputs. Smuggling is expected to boom. Examples: Steel requires iron ore. Most iron ore production is in relatively secure countries (Australia, Brazil, India, South Africa, Canada, US). However, major steel exporting countries (Ukraine, Germany, Russia, Korea, Japan, China) face significant complications. The world faces massive steel shortages despite overflowing iron ore supplies. Rare earths are critical for modern tech. While China dominates processing, the ore is not rare, and processing methods are known. Backups exist, and replacement of Chinese exports is possible within months if they vanish, although with hiccups. Nickel, crucial for stainless steel, is produced in places like Indonesia, Philippines, Australia, and Russia (though Russia's output is vulnerable). Silicon, vital for the Digital Age, requires purification done in only a few countries (China, Japan, US, Germany, Italy). About 80% of high-quality quartz for electronics comes from one mine in North Carolina, giving the US resource control over the base material of the Digital Age. Uranium, used for nuclear power, is sourced from ore and enriched. Post-Order, uranium might become more popular as it's the only electricity input that could theoretically be flown to end users. Major nuclear powers (US, Japan, France, China) are largely expected to maintain access to uranium.
    
- **Manufacturing:** Manufacturing became concentrated in East Asia under the Order. However, 2021 saw shortages of goods due to demand shifts caused by COVID lockdowns and openings, highlighting the fragility of global industrial retooling and supply chains. Just-in-time manufacturing, which relies on reliable global transport, is also vulnerable. Long and complex supply chains are highly susceptible to breakdown; even a small increase in component cost can ruin the economics. This is changing how things will be manufactured. Global economies of scale will vanish, and many current technologies won't be applicable in a fractured world. Examples of shifts: In automotive, the Texas-Mexico axis is well-positioned because many parts are already produced or assembled nearby, near the world's largest car market. Aerospace is expected to see Boeing take over global aviation, though the market will shrink significantly. Airbus, a multi-state conglomerate, faces challenges post-Brexit (UK provides wings/engines) and with key customers in the Persian Gulf potentially losing civilian aviation. Low-skilled sectors like textiles and wiring are seeing advances in automation make manufacturing in developed countries cheaper than using semi-skilled labor elsewhere. Textile production is expected to relocate to where natural fibers are harvested (US South, Australia, NZ) or near synthetic fiber production (US Gulf Coast), requiring few workers due to automation.
    
- **Agriculture:** This is the most important sector, as lack of food means mass death. Humanity domesticated wheat long ago, making settled life and complex societies possible. Industrialized agriculture relies heavily on inputs like fertilizer. Nitrogen fertilizers require oil or natural gas inputs, while phosphate fertilizers are made from mined rock. Global phosphate supplies are heavily concentrated in Morocco and the Western Sahara, and to a lesser extent the US and China. The US plus an enlarged Morocco could supply North America, South America, Europe, and Africa, but this is wretched news for everyone else if Russian and Chinese supplies disappear. Most farmers may have potassium surpluses for up to a decade, offering a brief buffer. The world is expected to face lower and less reliable agricultural yields with less variety. Export-driven monoculture will likely give way to small-scale, local-driven polyculture, reducing economies of scale and the aggregate volume of food produced globally. Many cash crops or for-export crops will become nonviable. Wheat shortages are expected globally. Regions like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Egypt face severe challenges due to large populations, reliance on Himalayan water (vulnerable to weaker monsoons), limited arable land, and inability to grow enough food even if inputs were available and all land shifted to staples. The Middle East, packed with energy but importing over two-thirds of its food, faces rapid population adjustments as global commodities trade craters. Some countries might use food as a geopolitical tool. Russia might use food diplomacy to consolidate control over Central Asian neighbors. France is expected to act neocolonial, securing dependencies for food (Belgium, Switzerland, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria) and energy (French West Africa). India might use food to control Bangladesh. Japan may regulate food shipments to Asia. While mitigating famine will be difficult, possibilities exist. Adding inputs to currently less productive but geographically favorable areas, like Myanmar with its rice terrain and river, could increase yields, though it requires outside countries willing to ignore its domestic policies. Unwinding "progress" means shifting to growing crops for local demand rather than export. This includes shifting towards wheat, oats, barley, rye, and cassava depending on climate. China has internal phosphate supplies, but they are in restive western regions far from populated areas, so maintaining access requires China staying intact. Important niche crops also face challenges. Palm oil, crucial for shelf-stable food, is mainly produced in Southeast Asia. Its loss is a first-world problem for taste but a developing-world crisis for food preservation, potentially guaranteeing seasonal famines. Cotton production is expected to be concentrated in the US and Brazil. Citrus looks good in places like Florida and northern Brazil that don't require irrigation, but places reliant on irrigation face challenges. Dairy production, especially high-value cheese, has a strong future in New Zealand and the US. Beef production, including zebu in India and Brazil, is expected to continue, with cheaper meat having appeal in a cost-constrained world.
    

**Consequences and "Decivilization"**

The unwinding is expected to be traumatic. Deglobalization doesn't simply mean a darker, poorer world; it means an unraveling. Not every location with the right geography for civilization before the Order will be able to maintain it after the Order's end. This process of reinforcing breakdowns that destroy the bedrock of modernity is termed "decivilization". It's one thing for a country like Mexico, wired into the US, to struggle through an industrial buildout, but another for a country like Korea to cope without imported oil, iron ore, foodstuffs, and export markets.

The collapse of global trade and demographics means economic free fall as everything underpinning humanity's economic existence since the Renaissance unwinds simultaneously. Different countries will feel the breakdown at different speeds and react based on their strengths, weaknesses, cultures, and geography. This will not happen under controlled circumstances but in the here and now of collapse. This is not a game for the weak; state piracy is expected to return.

**Bright Spots and Future Possibilities**

Amidst the gloom, there are a few bright spots. While most countries have experienced a collapse in birth rates alongside development, a precious few have managed a high degree of development while avoiding this: the United States, France, Argentina, Sweden, and New Zealand. However, even combined, their demographics aren't enough to support a new global system.

The author suggests looking at countries whose demographic and geopolitical realities have forced them to deal with the leading edge of this transformation sooner than others for potential inspiration or warnings. Perhaps the most notable takeaway is that the future, or at least the least traumatic adjustment, lies with the Americans (potentially in league with the Mexicans). The US population is young enough to keep growing for at least a few decades, even without inward migration. America's share of the global population is expected to increase, and it will retain control of the global oceans, have time to adapt its system, while the rest of the world fights over the shattered remnants of the collapsed economic system.

Potential Geographies of Success might include the United States, which will likely retain access to the Western Hemisphere and Australia and its military reach. A strongly integrated North America (US, Canada, Mexico) is seen as the least traumatic adjustment. The integration is expected to deepen, extending south into Mexico and potentially incorporating the UK and its manufacturing capacity into a NAFTA-like grouping. Argentina and the Southern Cone region (Paraguay, Uruguay, southern Brazil) are also highlighted as a potential industrial hub due to Argentina's educated population, labor access in neighbors, and local resources, all within a hemisphere secured by the Americans. These regions check the boxes for coherent and sustainable manufacturing systems in a world facing shortages.

In a capital-constrained world, familiar patterns will reassert themselves, favoring regions better able to generate and apply capital, such as Northern Europe over Southern Europe, India over Russia, Brazil over the Middle East, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa is seen as the world's last frontier for trade, with abundant industrial commodities that will attract outsiders. A new scramble for Africa is expected, but unlike the 1800s, African countries are partially industrialized and can fight back, requiring outside powers (primarily France and Britain) to partner with local authorities.

The author views the 2020s and 2030s as an "interregnum" – a transition period of instability. While uncomfortable, this period will pass. He sees potential silver linings around the 2040s. By 2040, younger Millennials will be generating capital, and Mexico's demographics are expected to look favorably balanced like the US in 2000. The North American continent's geographic and demographic strengths position it as a repository of past gains and a laboratory for the future, potentially emerging unassailably dominant.

**The Author's Perspective**

Zeihan acknowledges that his news is often bad and makes people unhappy. He identifies as an optimist, an internationalist, a Green (in his own way), and a democrat (little d), appreciating the progress of the past 75 years. However, he stresses that his job is to forecast what _will_ happen, not what he _wants_ to happen. He feels the chance for a better path was missed over a decade ago, noting a pattern of American disinterest in the wider world. There is no global savior or new hegemon waiting; secondary powers are reverting to antagonism. Europe, despite its peaceful history under the Order, has struggled to unite even on less contentious issues. The demographic collapse in most countries, particularly in developed and advanced developing nations where birth rates fell quickly, is expected to cause simultaneous consumption, production, and financial collapses in this decade.

He cannot provide a better way forward or a eulogy for what could have been. Geography doesn't change, demographics don't lie, and history shows how countries react to their environment. What he offers is a map of what's coming. He hints that exploring the opportunities and challenges of the period after the initial unraveling (cultural, economic, technological, climatic, demographic, geopolitical) will be a huge project, perhaps for a future book.

The coronavirus pandemic, arriving in early 2020, tragically robbed the world of time needed to prepare for the coming demographic devastation. Hyper face-conscious authorities in China suppressed initial information, transforming a local health concern into a global pandemic. Such ongoing disruptions are less a bug and more a feature of the world we are already devolving into. The delaying actions that kept history stuck are gone, and we are all rapidly advancing into the next age.

So, while the picture painted is grim, particularly for the 2020s and 2030s, understanding the forces at play – geopolitics, demography, and the unwinding of the American-led Order – provides a framework for navigating the challenging times ahead. It's the end of the world as we knew it, but, as the title suggests, perhaps just the beginning of something else.

If you're interested in exploring these ideas further, you might consider looking more deeply into the specific demographic trends in different countries, researching the historical context of pre-globalization trade patterns, or investigating the supply chains for critical industrial materials and how dependent various industries are on them. How might specific regions respond to the breakdown of global systems? What innovative solutions might emerge in the face of scarcity and disorder? There's a whole world of questions waiting to be explored on the other side of this unraveling!
