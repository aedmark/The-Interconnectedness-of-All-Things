Think of this book not just as something to read, but perhaps more like a collection of little windows opening onto a different way of seeing the world. Paul Reps compiled it, bringing together four fascinating texts that offer various perspectives on this often-mysterious topic.

The book itself is a treasury, really, comprised of four distinct sections, each with its own flavor and approach. They've been gathered together to give readers for the first time in one place experiences, mind problems, stages of awareness, and even a similar teaching that came along centuries before Zen.

Let's take a peek at each part:

First up is **101 Zen Stories**. These stories were originally transcribed into English from old Japanese sources like the _Shaseki-shu_ (which translates to "Collection of Stone and Sand") and other anecdotes about Zen monks from around the turn of the 20th century in Japan. These aren't fairy tales; they recount actual experiences of Chinese and Japanese Zen teachers stretching back over five centuries. They are designed to be easy to grasp, like little parables, focusing on self-discoveries.

The core idea behind these stories is that the self-discovered person is highly respected in the Orient, someone who aims to open their consciousness just like the Buddha did. Zen, in this context, is described not as a sect, but as an experience. It's seen as an "inner art and design," pointing directly to the "mind-essence of man" and "seeing directly into one's nature" to attain enlightenment. The stories often highlight disregard for rigid formalism, emphasizing self-discipline, simplicity, and self-searching through meditation. The spirit of Zen, as reflected in these stories, can manifest as peace, understanding, devotion to work and art, contentment, insight, and an appreciation for "the intangible charm of incompleteness". If you live with this spirit, the text suggests, things like fear, doubt, unnecessary craving, and extreme emotions don't trouble you; instead, you serve humanity humbly and experience life serenely.

The stories are quite varied, offering snapshots of Zen teachers interacting with students, laypeople, and even unexpected situations. For instance, there's the famous "A Cup of Tea" where Master Nan-in likens a professor's mind full of opinions to an overfull teacup – nothing more can be added until it's emptied. This simple image powerfully suggests the need to let go of preconceived notions to learn something new. Another story, "Is That So?", shows the master Hakuin remaining utterly calm and simply saying "Is that so?" when falsely accused and saddled with a child, only for the truth to later emerge. This highlights a remarkable level of equanimity. Or consider "Muddy Road," where Tanzan carries a beautiful woman across a muddy road, while his companion Ekido doesn't; later, Ekido criticizes Tanzan for interacting with a woman, and Tanzan replies, "I left the girl there. Are you still carrying her?" This often points to the Zen idea of letting go of mental baggage. These stories often use everyday situations to reveal profound insights, sometimes with a touch of humor or surprising directness.

Moving on, the second part is called **The Gateless Gate** (_Mu-mon-kan_ in Japanese). This is a collection of "problems" known as koans, first recorded by the Chinese master Ekai (also called Mu-mon) in 1228. Koans are used by Zen teachers as guides for students on their path toward release or enlightenment. The text explains that these koans were devised to "stop their students' word-drunkenness and mind-wandering". They aren't meant to be solved logically or intellectually; trying to understand Zen through explanation or clinging to words is compared to trying to beat the moon with a pole or scratch an itching foot from outside a shoe – impossible.

Instead, working on a koan is described as putting your mind, and everything else you have, to one purpose, allowing "it" to happen – that "it" being a sudden opening or realization. The book's introduction notes that the koan _is_ the answer, and the moment you have a "right answer" in a conventional sense, "Zen is dead". Koans are meant to be barriers or challenges that help a student break free from their "limited mind" and attain a "second eternal birth, satori, enlightenment". For example, the very first koan is Joshu's response "Mu" (meaning "No thing" or "Nay") to a monk's question, "Has a dog Buddha-nature or not?". This single word becomes a barrier for the student to work through, aiming to feel it "through every bone in your body, through every pore of your skin". It's presented as something you must work with intensely until your "ego-shell is crushed". The koan "Blow Out the Candle" describes how Tokusan became enlightened at the moment his teacher Ryutan blew out the candle he was offered, symbolizing perhaps the sudden extinguishing of conceptual understanding in favor of direct realization.

Third is **10 Bulls**, which is a translation from Chinese of a famous 12th-century commentary by the master Kakuan. This part uses a sequence of ten pictures (though only descriptions are provided in the text excerpt) and accompanying prose and verse comments to illustrate the stages of awareness leading to enlightenment. The bull represents the "eternal principle of life, truth in action". The sequence shows the process of searching for, finding, taming, and eventually transcending the bull, leading to a return to the world to help others.

Kakuan's version is noted as being "pure Zen," going deeper than earlier versions that stopped at "nothingness". The stages begin with the search, then discovering footprints, seeing the bull, catching it, taming it, riding it home (often depicted with the oxherder playing a flute), transcending the bull (realizing it was a temporary subject or tool), transcending both bull and self (entering No-Thing), reaching the source (seeing truth as clear from the beginning), and finally, entering the marketplace with helping hands (returning to the world). It's a beautiful visual and textual metaphor for the journey of spiritual unfolding, emphasizing that enlightenment isn't just about reaching a state of emptiness but also about integrating that realization back into everyday life and interaction with the world. The comment for the "Both Bull and Self Transcended" stage notes that in this state, "Mediocrity is gone. Mind is clear of limitation. I seek no state of enlightenment. Neither do I remain where no enlightenment exists," suggesting a freedom from seeking or clinging to particular states.

Finally, there is **Centering**. This section is a transcription of ancient Sanskrit manuscripts, described as presenting a teaching "still alive in Kashmir and parts of India after more than four thousand years". It's even suggested that this ancient teaching "may well be the roots of Zen". The text explains that this teaching was first chanted by Shiva to his consort Devi, and it's about "the immanent experience".

"Centering" offers 112 distinct "ways to open the invisible door of consciousness". These are not just concepts, but practical, often physical, techniques for focusing attention and awareness. They emphasize finding balance and awareness in various activities and states. The idea is that if we are conscious in part, there's a possibility for more inclusive consciousness. The methods are incredibly diverse, ranging from focusing on the breath (like the turns between inbreath and outbreath, or the pause between them), to using the senses (imagining colored circles, seeing inner being, touching eyeballs, listening to sounds), to body awareness (feeling light rays in the spine, pervading the form with cosmic essence, feeling the body as an empty room), and even engaging with everyday experiences (eating, drinking, singing, seeing, feeling a draft). Some methods involve focusing on mental states (attention between eyebrows before thought, unminding mind, contemplating beyond perception), while others involve interacting with the external world (looking into the blue sky, seeing blackness, observing an object and withdrawing sight/thought). Lakshmanjoo, who helped transcribe the text, highlights a few favorites, such as keeping attentive between the two breaths during worldly activity and the moment of being revealed at the point of sleep before it fully arrives. This collection offers a vast array of ancient techniques aimed at bringing awareness and presence into every aspect of existence.

Putting it all together, "Zen Flesh, Zen Bones" is a collection that aims to bypass purely intellectual understanding and point directly to experiential realization. The "101 Zen Stories" provide relatable, often surprising, anecdotes that illustrate Zen principles in action. "The Gateless Gate" offers challenging koans designed to break through conceptual thinking and trigger sudden insight. The "10 Bulls" visually and textually maps out the progressive stages of the journey toward and beyond enlightenment. And "Centering" provides ancient, tangible techniques for cultivating awareness and finding stillness and presence in the midst of life. While the sources come from different traditions and time periods (Zen from China/Japan, Centering from India), they are presented together as facets of a similar search for deeper consciousness and liberation. Ultimately, the book suggests that true Zen and its related paths are about direct experience, self-realization, and a transformation that allows one to live fully and harmoniously in the world.

This collection really invites you to ponder some fascinating questions. For instance, how do the sometimes paradoxical koans function differently from the straightforward instructions in "Centering"? How can we see the stages of the "10 Bulls" reflected in everyday learning or personal growth? And what might it mean to find "the sound of one hand" or to realize that "everything in my shop is the best"? The beauty of this book is that it provides glimpses, not definitions, encouraging your own exploration and discovery.
