Well, hello there! Let's take a fascinating journey into the pages of Jane Chance's book, "Lord of the Rings: The Mythology of Power," to explore some of the amazing insights it offers into J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved masterpiece. The goal here is to give you a super easy-to-read and interesting overview, getting into the juicy details without getting bogged down, and hopefully spark some new questions and ideas for you to ponder!

**What's This Book All About? Unpacking the "Mythology of Power"**

So, what exactly is this book, "The Mythology of Power," digging into? At its heart, it views _The Lord of the Rings_ (LotR) as a really powerful work of creative imagination. Published in three volumes back in the 1950s, LotR quickly became wildly popular, first sparked by the success of _The Hobbit_, which was originally for children. It led to millions of fans, especially in the 1960s and 70s, and has been translated into over twenty-two languages, cementing its place as a world masterpiece.

The book, written by Jane Chance (also known as Jane Chance Nitzsche, who wrote an earlier study in 1979 exploring the connections between Tolkien's minor and major works and his scholarship on Old/Middle English literature), looks at LotR through the lens of power. It sees Tolkien's story as a way of understanding big ideas for the twentieth century, like the nature of good and evil, how important community is, the natural order of things, and the unique value of each individual. Against a backdrop of the modern age, often associated with things like mechanization and totalitarian control (think "Big Brother"), where it might feel like individual freedom doesn't count for much, Tolkien wrote his story set in Middle-earth. He was responding to an era where individuals could feel powerless against fate and immense evil, whether that was seen in places like Auschwitz, Eastern Europe, South Africa, or even southern California. It's his fantasy about empowering the individual that the sources suggest has truly captivated audiences around the world.

**Tolkien's World: Built on Language and Old Tales**

To really get what makes Tolkien's world so special, the book highlights his background. Tolkien was a scholar of Old and Middle English language and literature, and his peers in England recognized this long before LotR came out. His career was hugely influenced by language itself, which he saw as a way to order reality. This intense interest led him to work on the _Oxford English Dictionary_ and become a professor at Oxford. This deep love for language and medieval tongues really saturates his fiction.

Academically, LotR's significance grew as medieval scholars recognized the crucial role of medievalism and philology (the study of language) in his made-up languages. For instance, a connection is made between medieval language/literature and Tolkien's work through lines from an Old English poem called "Crist" about Eärendel, which gave Tolkien a curious thrill and sparked his first creation, "The Voyage of Eärendel the Evening Star". Scholars have analyzed how medieval underpinnings influenced his literature and languages. His fiction was deeply influenced by Old and Middle English works he cherished and wrote criticism about, like _Beowulf_, _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_, and others. Even his scholarly essays, such as "Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics," and early fictional pieces like _The Hobbit_, influenced his later fiction. Tolkien even contributed to making the study of the Gawain-Poet easier through his editions and glossaries. It's quite amazing to think how his academic life and his creative life fed into each other so strongly!

The book also points out that the narrative structure and genre of LotR seem to have been influenced by classical and medieval stories. As an epic, it might mirror Virgil's _Aeneid_ or _Beowulf_, focusing on battles, heroic qualities like loyalty and valor, and descents into underworlds (like Mordor). As a saga, it resembles Norse-Icelandic Eddas, sagas, and the Finnish _Kalevala_. Its loosely episodic, branching quest structure is similar to a late-medieval romance characteristic called _entrelacement_. Other romance elements include symbolism, the idea of a quest, themes of search and transition, an atmosphere of death, and a young hero's development. Specific models identified include Sir Gawain (for Frodo's loss of innocence) and Perceval (for the quest's moral quality and religious seeking). What's really interesting, though, is how Tolkien sometimes _inverts_ these norms, like Frodo having to give up the quest, Gollum both hindering and achieving it, and heroes peacefully facing death. Even the medieval dream vision genre is suggested as a source for characters like Tom Bombadil.

Beyond narrative forms, philosophical ideas from late antique and early medieval sources also shaped LotR, particularly what could be seen as its "moral allegory". From Boethius's _Consolation of Philosophy_, Tolkien might have drawn the idea of reconciling providence, fate, and free will, which could explain the seemingly contradictory statements about chance and fate in the novel. Platonic and Neoplatonic philosophy seem linked to his theory of naming and the concept of equivocal reality, while Augustinian thought might influence his view of evil as a privation. Prudentius's _Psychomachia_ (battle between virtues and vices) could have influenced the fight between Sam, Frodo, and Shelob. And the whole novel seems governed by _discordia concors_, a medieval/Renaissance idea of order emerging out of disorder, with everything in its proper place.

Isn't it fascinating to see how deeply rooted LotR is in so many layers of ancient and medieval thought and literature? It certainly goes beyond just a simple fantasy story!

**Power Play: Tolkien Meets Foucault?**

Now, let's get to the "power" part of the book's title. The book suggests that Tolkien's fiction offers complex solutions to contemporary political, economic, and ideological problems, even touching on ideas voiced by thinkers like Michel Foucault. Foucault, a contemporary of Tolkien's influence period (the sixties and seventies), questioned the idea of power as something substantial, like sovereignty. Instead, he saw power as relations – a complex, constantly changing network or "grid". To understand this network, you have to look at the whole interplay, not just the individual's role, considering the "political field" it's part of. The book suggests Tolkien might agree with this idea of power being politicized.

The book highlights Foucault's concept of the "Panopticon," an architectural model where a central tower can oversee individuals in cells (like convicts, patients, workers, or students). This system relies on _visibility_ – the ability to see everyone – to ensure rigorous, universal control. The ultimate form of this is when individuals _internalize_ this gaze and become their own overseers, a "superb formula" for exercising power continuously at minimal cost. The book argues Tolkien uses a similar model to show the nature of power wielded by Sauron, Saruman, Shelob, and even the Sackville-Bagginses. Sauron's searching Eye is a prime example of this visibility. And mirroring Foucault's point that taking over the central tower in the Panopticon doesn't solve the problem (because the power is the _structure_, not who's in charge), the book echoes Frodo's point about "ownership" of the Ring – the power is in the Ring itself, not just the wielder.

Foucault also critiqued power as purely repressive or based on prohibition. Instead, he saw a positive desire for _productive_ power running through society. The book links this to the role of the intellectual, particularly the "specific intellectual" who becomes aware of struggles in their field. It draws an analogy between figures like J. Robert Oppenheimer (who had the knowledge to create the atomic bomb) and Tolkien's characters like Saruman, Gandalf, Bilbo, and Frodo, suggesting they function like specific intellectuals embodying the "proletariat". The book suggests Tolkien, like Foucault, was concerned with the political problem of the intellectual, not about "science" or "ideology," but about "truth" and "power". Foucault concluded that the political question isn't error or ideology, but truth itself, and the goal isn't to free truth from all power systems (since truth _is_ power), but to free the power of truth from existing forms of social, economic, and cultural control.

Liberating the power of truth from control is indeed presented as a major theme in LotR. The book frames LotR as a novel that mythologizes power and the issue of individual difference. Across its three volumes, it focuses on individual and class differences within society (in _Fellowship_), the power of knowledge and language in political struggles (in _Towers_), and the ideal of kingship as healing service, which uniquely inverts traditional master-servant roles and domination (in _Return_).

**Journey Through Middle-earth: Power Unfolds**

Let's see how the book explores these ideas volume by volume, following the structure it suggests Tolkien uses to reveal different aspects of power.

**Volume One: The Fellowship of the Ring - The Individual, Language, and Early Challenges**

The journey into this "mythology of power" often starts with the role of the individual in society, symbolized by Bilbo's "A Long-Expected Party". This celebration of the individual (Bilbo) is marked by his generous gift-giving and culminates in his disappearance. In Tolkien's world, intellectual heroism often comes through social involvement, serving others, and letting go of self-indulgence. The Ring itself, given by Bilbo to Frodo, symbolizes invisibility, which paradoxically "stretches" the self. Resisting the Ring's maker, Sauron, wears you out but can also strengthen your determination to resist over time.

Possessing the Ring is presented as meaning the individual loses their sense of identity and what they truly want. The Ring's "specialness" enhances the self, giving the illusion of power, which perhaps makes the wearer seem "queer" to others. Bilbo's initial struggle to give up the Ring, using language like Gollum ("It is mine, I tell you. My own. My precious. Yes, my precious"), shows this. Gandalf's demand for it makes Bilbo suspicious, but Gandalf wins him over by appealing to trust and help. Bilbo feels "queer," which the book suggests could represent his regret at giving up his power in the Shire, his "power as 'lord'," his specialness, wealth, and generosity. Renunciation is framed as the final gift, necessary for growth and maturity, requiring selflessness. Even the gifts Bilbo gives are seen as "corrective," meant to address faults in his relatives, though the poorer hobbits benefit regardless.

Frodo's quest is interestingly framed as a reversal of the idea that maturity means losing the child – the adult Frodo must try to "recuperate the child" as the Ring returns to its origin. While Bilbo "rules" the Shire through generosity, the Ring's rule is domination, aiming for sameness ("One Ring to rule them all"). Returning the Ring means rejecting this dominating power and accepting diversity. Frodo, already seen as "different" or "queer" by some Shire inhabitants due to his Brandybuck mother from Buckland near the Old Forest and his own oddity, is perhaps better suited for this quest. The term "queer" itself is used powerfully in the Shire to label individuals and exert control by playing on fears of difference.

Language is central in this volume, highlighted as a political tool and even seen as magic by Tolkien. It can unify diverse groups, help understand nature, and cross boundaries of time and space. In the Inn of Bree, language acts as a bond among different people. Those who understand multiple languages or communicate eloquently often achieve more. Aragorn, as a Ranger, understanding animal languages helps him. Frodo even uses song in Bree with hidden personal meaning. The book notes Frodo's growing perception of how tricky appearances and language can be, contrasting with Sam's innate sensitivity to a rogue like Bill Ferny.

Language is also shown as a dark, death-dealing force. The cold, miserable spell of the barrow-wights in the fog-bound barrow-downs is described as dark artistry, railing against life and cursing warmth, aimed at instilling fear, paralysis, and impotence. This spell reveals an animism in nature but also serves a Neoplatonic idea of Nature veiling God's Word. Tom Bombadil's lively charm, echoing early heroic poetry like incantation, counters this by rejuvenating the Hobbits.

Those subverted by evil, like the Black Riders (fallen Men), lose their ability to speak independently, hissing and muttering instead. Their strength lies in darkness and loneliness, symbolizing despair or irrationality. Even clues left by Gandalf are a form of language, whose ambiguity (like the door to Moria needing a password) can be a dilemma for the "scholar-hero" Frodo. Lack of communication is associated with isolation and fear.

The knowledge conferred by the Ring is power. Wearing it to gain knowledge (to "see, to know") counters terror but brings physical danger and spiritual weakening, although the inner self paradoxically strengthens. This is seen as a Faustian bargain: godlike knowledge for loss of soul. The wound Frodo receives from a Black Rider is transcendentally evil, suggesting more than just physical harm.

The climax of Book 1 involves the ultimate threat: being struck dumb, paralyzed, losing language and action, becoming stone. To counter this, the opposite must happen: flesh must become word, enlivened. This occurs when Frodo confronts the Black Riders at the Ford, demanding they return to Mordor (meaning "death" in Old English). When the Riders demand the Ring, calling with "deadly voices," Frodo is struck dumb, his tongue cleaving to his mouth. He is saved by Gandalf, whose power fills the horses with madness. Losing one's tongue means losing rationality and selfhood, linking to the Ringwraiths being ghosts of their former selves. Book 2 follows, marking Frodo's transformation into a political Hobbit.

**Volume One: The Fellowship of the Ring - Book 2: Language and Democracy**

Book 2 is seen as a complement and mirror image to Book 1. At Rivendell, Frodo learns how the Ring changes perception, making others seem "queer" and antagonistic. When Bilbo asks to see the Ring, Frodo sees him as a "little wrinkled creature with a hungry face," feeling a desire to strike him. This creatively reconstructs the psychology of selfishness and cupidity, showing how the Ring's "shadow" cripples higher nature and alters perception, hindering unity.

The Ring's power is seen as stifling democracy within a community. Bearing it is a huge challenge to Frodo's political education. How can he distinguish true vision from false when the Ring shadows his perception?. The Council of Elrond is presented as a model for democracy. Despite past history, various peoples debate how to counter Sauron. The council succeeds partly due to the modesty of Gandalf and Aragorn, who admit their faults.

Through helpful exchanges, the group logically arrives at the only solution Sauron won't anticipate because it's unlike his desire for power. Even old enmities (Elves vs. Dwarves) erupt but are guided back to the main issue by Gandalf. The council openly asks for solutions: giving the Ring to Bombadil, keeping it, destroying it, sending it over the Sea, hiding it, or "unmaking it". Elrond proposes the hard road to Mordor, recognizing that the desire for the Ring corrupts the heart. They choose the smallest, least greedy species, the Hobbits, as the Ringbearer.

This democracy means the seemingly humblest are chosen for the greatest journey. Frodo volunteers with misgiving but steps forward because Elrond suggests "small hands" can move the world when the "eyes of the great" look elsewhere. Sam, hidden, volunteers out of concern for Frodo. They aren't forced but volunteer willingly, knowing no one else can.

Words, speeches, and songs are important weapons against the wordlessness sought by Sauron and Saruman. The Elven rings, unlike the One Ring, weren't for war but for understanding, making, and healing. The password to Moria, "friend," is seen as key to the Company's progress, "absurdly simple, like most riddles".

The Dwarf mines of Moria are marked by Durin's Bane, the greedy desire for mithril, which brought wealth but also destruction – they "delved too greedily and too deep". Durin's "sleep" (death) is symbolized by his crown in Mirrormere. This sleep echoes the dark sleep of the Old Forest or barrow-wights and is linked to the shadowy ghostliness of the Ringwraiths. Another riddle is deciphered by reading runes on Balin's tomb, revealing he also succumbed to the Bane. Recovering the past through these texts brings understanding, contrasting with the darkness of ignorance. The exploration is a trek into the past recorded in books like the Book of Mazarbul.

The monstrous desire of Durin and Balin is sometimes identified with a literal monster, the Balrog, described as a great shadow, symbolizing inarticulate violence and primordial wrath. The Balrog, as incarnate Otherness and human shapelessness, represents the threat to community, the violence that destroys, foreshadowing Boromir's threat to the Fellowship. Haldir the Elf blindfolding Legolas also shows a reaction to difference.

Galadriel's gentle wisdom in Lothlórien educates the Company about dangers. Her gaze probes their inner drives. Sam feels exposed, like she's looking inside him and testing his desire for home. She tests everyone. Only Boromir doubts her purpose, forgetting Aragorn's point that evil in the land comes from within.

Galadriel's Mirror offers real vision – past, present, or future. Sam's vision shows future threats to the Shire, places/people he loves. Frodo's is grander: Gandalf wandering, Bilbo restless, the Sea, and Sauron's Eye watching him. The Eye's gaze will heavily test Frodo. Frodo, as Ringbearer, inadvertently tests Galadriel by offering her the One Ring, which she refuses, accepting her own future diminution.

Lórien is presented as a regenerative halfway house that restores and tests the Company. Paradise is seen as a responsibility, a moral weight, unlike Bombadil's house. Gifts from Lórien include waybread (lembas) that strengthens, robes sensitive to weather/gaze, and individual gifts echoing Bilbo's party. Sam receives earth for rebuilding, and Frodo receives the light of Eärendel's star (the Phial), weapons against adversaries like Shelob and for healing Middle-earth. These offer moral support and hope. Gimli requesting a strand of Galadriel's hair symbolizes generosity countering Dwarvish avarice (Durin's Bane). His transformation involves a painful lesson about inner peril, realizing leaving paradise is harder than never knowing it. Memory and voluntary renunciation bring consolation.

At the end of Book 2, Frodo, isolated on Amon Hen (Hill of Seeing), uses the Ring to see visions like in Galadriel's Mirror, but geographically organized. He is challenged by Sauron's Eye (representing hegemonic authority) but resists its gaze by listening to an inner voice and removing the Ring. This strengthens his resolve to go alone, protecting the Ring from weaker wills like Boromir's. His main desire is to help Middle-earth, even sacrificing himself.

**Volume Two: The Two Towers - Language, Difference, and Empowerment**

_The Two Towers_ strongly dramatizes language's power. Diminished life is seen in Gollum's baby talk to his "Precious," while elevated life (Elves) is in their language, song, naming ability, and hold on the past. Orcs are greedy and manipulated by language. Ents have memory, thinking power, and songs.

Tolkien insists power must be shared with those who are different (gender, nature, history, temperament). Leaders must tolerate difference rather than suppress it. LotR is described as a story of difference articulated, nearly crushed, then restored. _Towers_ intensifies the nature of difference when domination is involved.

Book 3's two narrative strands (like the two towers) symbolize difference and division. The "superior" members of the Fellowship (Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli) search for the "lost" Hobbits (Merry and Pippin, and later Sam and Frodo). The Hobbits are presented as not inferior but more important – the story revolves around them. Tolkien valorizes the marginal and seemingly impotent, flipping power relationships. The three companions must follow the Hobbits, a humbling experience. They must decipher riddles – signs left by the Hobbits – requiring them to understand Hobbit nature and forget themselves. Riddles include the missing horses and the Hobbits' escape method. Legolas figures out how one escaped but not fully why. Aragorn understands an Orc was killed and hauled away, noting the Hobbit carried lembas – "that, perhaps, is like a hobbit". Aragorn also grasps Orc treachery. Elf and Man are more sensitive to Hobbit nature, and Legolas senses the darkness of Fangorn. Even Gimli the Dwarf learns to accept the Elf, showing a "strange marriage of opposites," a "fellowship" of Dwarf and Elf epitomizing a future coexistence of nations.

Help comes from Gandalf, re-emerging as Mithrandir, the White. Gandalf speaks in riddles, explaining his habit of talking to the wisest person present (himself). His clarification to Aragorn shows Tolkien's concept of knowledge of difference as power. Sauron cannot understand his adversaries (Hobbits, Fellowship) because he is limited by his own desire and selfishness. He assumes they act as he would.

The ambiguity of signs is highlighted when the Company is unsure if the figure they see is Gandalf or Saruman. Gandalf's return involves a metamorphosis through death and despair, echoing a path the Company must choose. His fight with the Balrog led him through darkness and being sent back "naked and forgotten". The Company learns from the Elves (in Lórien) the way of victory and that their future depends on acknowledging past mistakes, aided restoratively by the Dead Company.

Knowledge, language, and power manifest through dramatic confrontations. Théoden emerges as a wise leader by overcoming despair caused by Wormtongue's manipulative words. Saruman falls because he refuses hope in his self-created prison of incomplete knowledge. Wormtongue, Saruman's bad servant, becomes "Worm" of the snarling "Sharkey" (Saruman), also a bad servant of Sauron. Rohan (Théoden) and Isengard (Saruman) devolve, mirroring their cleverness diminishing into wordless animality, signifying moral decay. They also finance Lotho Sackville-Baggins, linking back to the Shire's beginning. The name reflects the true nature: Worm is a worm, Sharkey a shark.

In Rohan, the reader confronts a language barrier imposed by Wormtongue: only those who know the tongue and are friends can enter. This literal barrier is ironic, as the country's ruin came from words, not swords. The demand to leave weapons is also ironic given the power of Wormtongue's counsel. Aragorn counters with a powerful spell of words, asserting command over his sword, demonstrating words' greater power than swords and history's greater power than present words.

The conflict in Rohan is a battle of wills and of kings (Théoden vs. Aragorn). Who is the rightful king?. Who says Gandalf's staff is just a stick?. Háma, the guardian, trusts his wisdom and allows Gandalf entry with his staff, believing they are friends. Háma may have already known the king was ruled by his counselor.

Wormtongue operates by exploiting Théoden's fear, relaying bitter news like his son's death. He twists words, calling Gandalf "Ill-news" (Láthspell). He denigrates Gandalf and his followers based on their appearance. His skewed logic suggests the bearer of ill tidings must be evil, and one in ragged clothing a beggar.

Gandalf sheds his weak appearance to reveal the truth, rebuking Wormtongue as a "witless worm" with a "forked tongue" who twists words for his own purpose, not Rohan's. Wormtongue's counsel heightened Théoden's fear to subvert his role to that of a "serving-man". Gandalf's rescue brings light and hope through encouraging words, restoring Théoden. He urges courage and wisdom, telling Théoden to look abroad instead of trusting "twisted tales and crooked promptings".

The suspicions and fears of the guardians and resistance to difference reflect darkness within the tribe. The chief danger came from within, from the seemingly familiar Wormtongue. Tolkien again stresses language's power to destroy or restore and that true knowledge sees good beneath superficial difference.

Gandalf counsels facing fear, conquering self-pity, and trusting. He tells Théoden hope lies in Mordor, where their greatest fear resides (Frodo/Sam vs. Sauron), and doom hangs by a thread. When Théoden laments his old age and lack of sword, Gandalf reminds him kings command in battle, and gripping a sword would restore strength. A sword symbolizes power, physical and political; its return acknowledges strength. Éomer, a true servant, returns Théoden's sword, and strength returns to him.

Rohan shows the old can be stronger than they look. Similarly, Éowyn proves the most valorous warrior can be female. She is granted lordship in their absence. Hobbits, the elderly, and females hold heroic roles. Háma's wisdom in trusting Gandalf and advising Éowyn's leadership shows he sees beneath the surface.

Book 3's second major battle of words happens at Orthanc between Gandalf and Saruman. Saruman, a traitor to the White Council, inadvertently serves Sauron by using the palantír, which Sauron controls. Wormtongue serves Saruman, who serves Sauron.

The book adds trees, Ents, and Huorns to the list of marginalized who become heroes. Merry and Pippin, the seemingly superfluous Hobbits, become "door-wardens" after their escape, assuming new identities. They face patronizing words from Gimli and Legolas but respond with wit. Even the greater, stronger companions treat the smaller ones literally, repeating Wormtongue's error.

Théoden, however, shows true leadership by courteously respecting the Hobbits' language and difference, bowing to them. He acknowledges that "there are no legends of their deeds" but immediately adds, "But it seems that more could be said," showing he doesn't use hearsay to denigrate them. Trust, openness, toleration, and good manners are qualities of a political leader.

Desire and fear, oratorical weapons, are ineffective against plain truth. Gimli notes Saruman's language is reversed ("help means ruin, saving means slaying"). Éomer adds fear by reminding Théoden of Saruman's treachery. Saruman is the "trapped wolf". Théoden's plain speech ("Harsh as an old raven's their master's voice") contrasts with Saruman's music. Théoden's refusal leads to Saruman's snakelike transformation and insults ("Dotard!").

The final contest in Book 3 is between Pippin and Sauron via the palantír. The temptation to look is strong. Pippin succumbs but his "loss" is a victory because Sauron assumes he's a prisoner in Orthanc, delaying the discovery of the true Ringbearer near Mordor. Sauron's literalism, ignorance, and pride reduce his power, and the marginalized protagonist succeeds because of this.

**Volume Two: The Two Towers - Book 4: The Articulate Body**

Book 4 shifts focus to Sam and Frodo's journey towards Mordor, linking Isengard and Mordor through the palantír. The themes of dehumanization and the interior drama of servant (Sam) and master (Frodo) intensify. The book asks about knowledge without language, power without speech, and when silence or disordered sound becomes bestiality like Shelob. The emptiness of the land where birds fall dumb is noted. It poses questions about whether uncontrolled irrationality (Shelob) is worse than cunning (Saruman), and if degeneration can be undone.

Symbolic settings like the Dead Marshes, Faramir's Garden, and Cirith Ungol develop these ideas. Betrayal and service are opposite extremes, but betrayal can be service, and service (like Wormtongue's or Saruman's) can be betrayal. Who decides?. Gollum's betrayal of Frodo, Frodo's failure to protect Gollum, and Sam's choices as Ringbearer are explored.

Sauron's Eye is a searching, paralyzing force, a gaze of hostility and annihilation directed at the different. For Gollum, the Ring's lure conflicts with his promise to Frodo. Darkness brings out latent desire and fear. The Dead Marshes represent despair. The wasted land encountered afterward is defiled and diseased.

Gollum's moral way out is to deny responsibility by transferring it to another agency, like Shelob. If she kills the Hobbits, Gollum is free to take the Ring without breaking his literal promise. This is a neat sidestepping of morality through rationalization. The guarded pass at Cirith Gorgor increases pressure on Gollum as Frodo's resolve is firm. Gollum wants to serve Frodo and avoid Sauron, whom he fears. The path to Shelob's lair is the path of least resistance, or rationalization. Did Gollum deceive Frodo or help him?.

Faramir advises against trusting Gollum, but Frodo must uphold his promise to protect him. Violating that promise would be treachery on Frodo's part. "The servant has a claim on the master for service, even service in fear". Most characters here seem to show "apparent treachery". Sam's desire to cook reflects his strong motivation to serve his master, helping them get rest and refreshmen through Faramir's discovery. Resisting the Ring proves good stewardship, humility, and lack of selfishness. Smoke from cooking is a communication, a sign of civilization in a land without language.

Faramir's encounter is analogous to Galadriel's mirror in Book 2, arming them with knowledge. Minas Morgul, the Tower of the Moon (once Minas Ithil) captured by the Nazgûl, represents emptiness of intelligence ("Orthanc" means "Cunning Mind"). Its windows are "black holes looking inward into emptiness," its revolving top a "huge ghostly head leering". Here, Frodo's loyalty is tested by the desire to wear the Ring, revealing his presence. The spiritual/intellectual emptiness of Minas Morgul signifies blankness and indifference, a key peril to Frodo's success.

When Frodo feels the urge to put on the Ring near a Black Rider, his hand moves towards it as if watched by his mind but without his will, like looking at an old story. His will stirs, forcing his hand to find the Phial of Galadriel instead. The Phial counters the nihilism and domination threatening him. It also helps him turn away Shelob at her tunnel. Sting cuts cobwebs. But neither is enough against Shelob's malice and Gollum's treachery. Shelob captures Frodo, and Gollum attacks Sam.

Frodo faces multiple adversaries: the Ring's will, Sauron/Nazgûl, and the mindlessness of Shelob. Sam faces them differently. Sam, as Ringbearer, lacks self-mastery experience, highlighted by his difference from Frodo (genealogy, vocation). His anger at Gollum mirrors Shelob's malice. His attack on Shelob is fierce, like a small creature attacking a tower. The Phial burns Shelob back. Crucially, wearing the Ring heightens Sam's _hearing_, allowing him to understand Orcs and learn Frodo is alive (Shelob doesn't eat dead meat). This act of wearing the Ring, though precipitous, gives him the chance to change course from dutiful Ringbearing to rescuing his master. Like other heroes, Sam resists the temptation to become Lord.

Sam's lesson is not just that knowledge (via language) is power, but the source matters. He scolds himself, realizing his heart knew Frodo was alive and his head is not his best part. Like Saruman, he denied hope; like Shelob, he reacted angrily; like Gollum, he seemingly abandoned his master. His rule was "Never leave your master," and he feels he broke it.

**Volume Three: The Return of the King - Power, Community, and Return**

_The Return of the King_ knits together the divided narrative strands from _Towers_. The splitting continues, with Frodo left for dead while Sam goes on, and Merry joining Théoden while Pippin goes with Gandalf to Gondor. This "decimation" of the Company and narrative is resolved in the third volume, fittingly named _Return_. Eventually, all strands meet in Minas Tirith after Frodo and Sam return the Ring. Journeys in Books 5 and 6 (to Minas Tirith, Cirith Gorgor) echo journeys in Books 3 and 4 (to the Two Towers) and anticipate the return to the Shire. Destinations seem wasted cities or sources of power. The return to the Shire shows corruption exists even in familiar communities, affecting caring leaders.

The "return of the hero" is a unifying image. Boromir returns dead, Faramir alive. Aragorn returns alive as King. The Ring and its "Lord" return to Mordor/Mount Doom. Gollum remains the true Lord of the Rings in Mordor. Frodo and Sam return to the Shire, Frodo as hero, Sam as servant. Yet Sam becomes mayor, while Frodo leaves for the Grey Havens. Tolkien is interested in individuals entering/leaving the community and the power they bring. Communication between individuals, leaders, and parts of a community is key to community itself.

Book 5's structure explores real leadership, power, and language as a reflection of knowledge. The first part focuses on the Fellowship fragments reaching Gondor. After the external battle, the internal battles of Gondor's leaders are completed. Finally, the army goes to the Black Gate.

Pippin's Oath of Service to Denethor in Book 5 highlights power within a larger construct. This oath solidifies individual-community relationships, reflecting the ruler's commitment too. The appropriate roles of ruled and ruler transform in Book 6 with the homecomings of various kings.

Book 5's destination is Gondor ("Stone-land"), founded by Elendil and ruled by Stewards after the line died out, awaiting the true King, Aragorn. The goal is not just Gondor but community itself. Gandalf/Pippin seek to help Gondor resist the Enemy. Aragorn/Gimli/Merry/Théoden/Faramir go via the Paths of the Dead to gather the Oathbreakers. Éowyn also joins, disguised.

The Siege at Gondor and grand battle aren't the ultimate goal. Tolkien focuses on the verbal confrontation before the battle, between the "Mouth of Sauron" (Lieutenant of Barad-dûr) and Gandalf. The Towers of the Teeth imply a mouth into Mordor, mirrored by the Lieutenant's verbal antagonism. This "seeming" suggests more ways to fight than physical might, as Frodo, Sam, Gollum, and the Eagles prove.

Minas Tirith ("Tower of Guard"), city of Man, reflects Gondor as a blighted, paralyzed "stone land". Its gated structure anticipates the Black Gate. The Great Gate, dividing the city circles, mirrors the divided community of Man, whose Steward, Denethor, has seized the Ruler's power.

Denethor is a "proud and subtle" father who loved Boromir too much. His unbalanced love and skewed judgment are signs of political dysfunction. His excessive grief and irrational anger towards the Hobbits (for Boromir's death) and Faramir foreshadow his madness. Gandalf warns him, "Be not unjust in your grief!" but justice is beyond him. He accepts Pippin's offer coldly, demanding a legal oath of fealty. Denethor's suspicion towards Pippin, asking how he escaped while Boromir died facing only Orcs, reveals a personal and political mistake: his literalism equates "small" with helpless and "large" with strong. This flaw also affected Saruman and Sauron. Seeing clearly means understanding greatness of spirit and goodness, regardless of size.

The "contest" between Steward and servant (Pippin) revolves around service and obedience. Pippin responds proudly to the scornful suspicion. He offers service generously and masks Boromir's perfidy. Though Pippin swears obedience, his later "disobedience" (continuing to serve after being released) saves Gondor. This infraction marks obedience to the higher goal of fealty to Gondor, not just the mad Steward. Éowyn similarly disobeys Théoden but saves Gondor. Sam disobeys Frodo regarding the Ring but saves him. Gollum disobeys Frodo at the end. The book suggests the lesser is greater, the serving Steward is the true Ruler, and arrogant tyrants are inept kings.

Denethor's verbal contest with Gandalf echoes Wormtongue and Saruman. Conflict arises from the Steward's misguided, self-deceived "Service". Gandalf criticizes Denethor's self-indulgence in his grief, neglecting Gondor's troubles because he thinks he knows enough from using the palantír. The Stone, which he believes serves him, blinds him to the need for counsel.

Gandalf and Pippin are foils, concealing Aragorn's return from the Steward's hidden ambition. Pippin's courtesy and generosity contrast with the ruler's arrogance. Pippin's friend, Beregond, offers companionship and service during desperate times. Bergil, Beregond's son, also fears marginalization but serves courageously.

Merry's loving commitment to Théoden contrasts with Pippin's legal obligation to Denethor. Both acts show the perceived unimportance of Hobbit servants ("Don't leave me behind, like baggage"). Merry's service saves Théoden; Pippin's "disservice" saves Gondor. Merry swears fealty to the man, not the nation. Théoden names him "esquire of Rohan," contrasting with Pippin's role as "servant of Gondor".

While Denethor's will fails against Sauron via the palantír, Aragorn's is barely a match. Aragorn, the rightful owner, reveals himself to Sauron (a bad steward to Morgoth). This "return" of the King demoralizes Sauron. This contest also gives Aragorn insight into the peril facing Minas Tirith and the need to summon the Oathbreakers via the Paths of the Dead.

Summoning Rohan leads to Merry and Éowyn being left behind, but both disobey in disguise. Merry rides with Éowyn, disobeying Théoden; Éowyn (as Dernhelm) disobeys Aragorn. At the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, they redeem this disobedience. Éowyn kills the Nazgûl lord, fulfilling the prophecy "No living man may hinder me". Merry's service to the felled Théoden involves courage as a "king's man" and "son". He also protects Éowyn from the Ringwraith lord and from her own despair, seeing her seeking death, having no hope.

The meeting of Faramir and Denethor shows the capable vs. flawed ruler. Denethor suspects Faramir's fidelity, judgment, and love. He is a Steward greedy for control. Faramir resists the Ring's power, unlike Boromir. Denethor accuses Faramir of listening to Gandalf more than him, believing it's a mistake in love. But the book suggests duty to nation supersedes duty to father; the latter would be treachery. Denethor wishes Faramir had died instead of Boromir, who was "loyal" and wouldn't have "squandered what fortune gave" (the Ring). Denethor confuses love with service, desire with need, and power with value. His greatest crime might be putting himself before Middle-earth, seeing the Ring as a test of love.

The Ring is the true test for kingship, overcoming even the strongest wills. Gandalf warns Denethor that Boromir would have taken the Ring for himself, not brought it back. The Ring's power would also have overcome Denethor's disordered mind, despite his idea of hiding it. Denethor is weak, and Gandalf suspects he would be tempted to use it. What Gandalf doesn't know is Denethor is already compromised by using the Stone, revealing himself to Sauron.

The Lord of the Nazgûl, a false lord, confronts three types of leadership at the Gate of Gondor. Gandalf verbally refuses him. Mad Denethor gives up his will, hope, and son, dying resisting rescue. Aragorn proves kingship by healing, not just wielding a sword – the "rightful king" is known by laying on healing hands.

The healing power of the King extends to Faramir, Éowyn, and Merry, sick with the Black Shadow. The illness resembles Frodo's from barrow-wights/Black Riders. The cure is athelas (kingsfoil), whose restorative power is compared to memories of a beautiful land. It rejuvenates the psyche. Faramir awakens acknowledging Aragorn as king with "light of knowledge and love". The herb's power summons service, spurring vitality in response to care. It images the obedient love of servant for master and protective love of master for servant.

Gandalf offers a second antidote to despair. As wizard, he guides Middle-earth but rejects power symbols like the key to Gondor. His counsel to lords before battle is restorative, using his wits to face truth. He acknowledges Denethor's truth from the Stone that there's no victory against Sauron. But Gandalf tells them not to despair but to "ponder the truth" – victory must come another way. A steady gaze at present reality is more effective than deceiving glimpses into the future via the Stone. Gandalf uses reality to advantage: victory won't come through might but by returning the Ring. To distract Sauron, they must assemble for the grand battle he expects.

The Eagles saving Frodo are a sign of natural grace, power returning to its source. This counters Gandalf's near-despair. The Messenger showing Sam's sword, Elven cloak, and Frodo's mithril shirt confirms their presence but doesn't guarantee survival or success. Gandalf must think like Sauron, believing "little" means inferior and power means physical strength. He finds courage to treat the returned items as ransom for "one servant".

Imagination, wisdom, hope, courage are vital for leaders, stewards, and servants. Pippin masters his horror at Gandalf's words, saving Beregond despite his own despair ("But now I must do my best"). These qualities reappear in Frodo (scholar) and Sam (gardener), seemingly useless but ultimately heroic. Powerless and small, they complete the mission with perseverance and pluck through a single unwitnessed act of renunciation requiring moral, not physical, strength.

**Volume Three: The Return of the King - Book 6: The Final Confrontation and Homecoming**

Book 6 initially focuses on Sam, then Frodo, then their battle with Gollum. Each Ringbearer reacts differently: Sam with heightened senses (hearing Orcs, learning Frodo isn't dead), Frodo with heightened knowledge but distorted vision, and Gollum with heightened force. When Sam's light fails, he counters despair by singing an original song, leading to him finding the entrance to Frodo's prison. When Frodo asks for the Ring back, he sees Sam as a "foul little creature" due to the Ring's influence, but his long experience lets him see "humanly," seeing Sam's pain.

Sam resists giving up the Ring but understands he must. He withstands the temptation to claim it, unlike Boromir. Sam's temptation vision is earthy and sensuous: Samwise the Strong conquering with a flaming sword, armies flocking to him, turning Mordor into a fertile garden. This reflects his gardener role.

The greatest peril for both Hobbits is Gollum's violent strength and madness. Gollum is a foil for Sam and Frodo, who act as one in the final stages. Responsible leader Frodo bears the Ring; strong Sam bears debilitated Frodo. Willpower (Sam's) and Eucharistic-like grace (lembas) enable them. When hope fades, new strength rises in Sam; he becomes like stone/steel against despair. Lembas strengthens endurance.

Their fight involves stripping away the extraneous to lighten their load, eventually including Frodo himself. Sam's service is so great he becomes "body to Frodo's soul," literally guiding his hand away from the Ring. Sam becomes a parent figure, bearing Frodo like a child. Just as the True King heals like a mother, the true servant serves. Heroism becomes the simple love a mother offers, sustaining will alongside defiance/lembas.

At the very end, roles blur. Frodo succumbs to the Ring, putting it on, failing his deed. Gollum, long succumbed, bites off the finger, chanting "Precious," falls into Mount Doom. Was this sacrificial service?. Did Frodo fail? They averted Sauron's gaze, and the Ring is destroyed. Frodo recalls Gandalf's words: "Even Gollum may have something yet to do". Gollum made it possible. Each of the three Ringbearers played a role, especially Gollum, the most deformed.

Finally, the Hobbits return to the Shire, finding it under the tyranny of Sharkey and Wormtongue. This "trespassing" by the heroes upon a disordered Shire shows corruption can affect even nonthreatening communities. Freedom is abridged, homogeneity imposed to disempower the "little folk". The Hobbit heroes, encouraged by their travels, lead a revolt. Frodo's difference is now seen as valuable and heroic; he laughs at arrest. Merry uses his Rohan horn to rouse the Hobbits. They defeat the jeering men (killing their leader) and then Sharkey, ridding the Shire of violence and tyranny. Men refusing Merry's command are defeated. The Battle of Bywater names are recorded, with Merry and Pippin listed as "Captains".

**The Structure of Heroism: Departure and Return**

The book concludes by looking at the heroic structure, comparing it to Joseph Campbell's monomyth phases of "Departure" and "Return". These phases frame Tolkien's story. What the Hobbits learn wounds and heals them and the Shire. The three volumes structure these adventures using a repeating pattern in each of the six books: separation from community, descent into an underworld (learning), ascent into an overworld (grace), and return to reintegrate.

Each volume's structure mirrors its books. _Fellowship_'s Book 1 (chapters 1-5) mirrors Book 2 (chapters 1-3), with Book 1 being a natural, literal journey in the present and Book 2 a figurative journey into the past. Book 1's natural world (Shire, Bree) contrasts with Book 2's supernatural landscapes (Moria, Lothlórien). Frodo's learning differs: Book 1 is about life/death against natural peril, Book 2 about moral understanding transcending factual sight against a historical backdrop.

The "underworld" descent in Book 1 (chapters 6-8) is the natural Old Forest ("death-in-life"). In Book 2 (chapters 4-5), the supernatural descent is into the Mines of Moria, a place of past death from greed (spiritual death). Barrow-wights (life-in-death) reflect past civilizations, while the Balrog epitomizes spiritual monstrosity ("Durin's Bane"). The sleep spells of Old Man Willow and the fog are narcotics clouding reason, like the darkness/gloom in Moria, which subverts judgment among nations, leading to sin.

Ascent to safety differs. The safety at the Inn in Bree (Book 1, chapters 9-11) corresponds to the spiritual peace in Lothlórien with the Elves (Book 2, chapters 6-8). Book 1's "Big Folks" contrast with Book 2's lofty Elves. The literal guide Strider in Book 1 appears threatening but leads safely. The spiritual guide in Book 2 is Galadriel, who asks questions and tests the Company.

At the end of each book, Frodo faces dilemmas. Book 1: physical danger (Black Riders). Book 2: psychological danger (Boromir, the Ring). Heroism varies: Book 1, brandishing a sword; Book 2, refusing Boromir and going alone.

_Towers_' structure (Books 3 and 4) traces the divided Company. Book 3 follows Merry/Pippin, Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli, and Gandalf; Book 4 follows Sam/Frodo. The descent/ascent pattern repeats. Book 3 begins with departures/death (Frodo/Sam leaving, Boromir dying, Merry/Pippin captured). Instead of a lecture, clues and riddles are used to track the missing. The reduced Fellowship uses knowledge to find Merry/Pippin and summon leaders. They descend into "underworlds" of death-in-life: Gandalf rescuing Théoden from despair (Wormtongue's influence) and verbally battling Wormtongue. Merry/Pippin escape the "dark company" (Orcs). The battle at Helm's Deep is in an underworld vale. Gandalf confronts Saruman at Orthanc, exposing his deceptive words.

Otherworldly help in Book 3 includes Gandalf as the White Rider rescuing the Rohirrim and the Ents protecting Merry/Pippin. Gandalf and the Ents meet at Isengard, providing victory. The help is wise strategy: Ents trapping Saruman, Gandalf exposing his deceit. Resources like Gandalf's wizardry and the Ents' strength are seen as supernatural skills of leaders helping others. The Ents hint at regenerated heroism from a lost paradise; Gandalf's return suggests a resurrected savior.

**Further Ideas to Explore:**

This look into "The Mythology of Power" opens up so many avenues for thinking about _The Lord of the Rings_!

- How else might Tolkien's deep knowledge of specific medieval texts manifest in unexpected ways in the story?
- Could we find more instances of the "Panopticon" model in Middle-earth beyond Sauron's Eye? Does it apply to smaller power dynamics?
- Thinking about power as relations, how does the network of alliances and conflicts among the Free Peoples and under Sauron's rule illustrate this idea?
- The book highlights the empowerment of the marginalized. Can you identify other characters or groups who fit this pattern and how their "difference" becomes a source of strength?
- Considering language as power, what are some other examples in the book where specific words, names, songs, or even silences have significant effects on the characters or plot?
- The idea of "disobedience" leading to salvation is intriguing. What does this tell us about the nature of authority and morality in Tolkien's world?
- How does the repeating heroic structure (separation, descent, ascent, return) shape our understanding of character development and the overall narrative arc? Can you map this pattern onto other characters' journeys?

Digging into these layers really makes you appreciate the depth of Tolkien's creation and the insightful ways critics like Jane Chance help us understand it. It's a world built not just on fantasy creatures and quests, but on complex ideas about what it means to be an individual, part of a community, and how power truly operates. Happy exploring!
