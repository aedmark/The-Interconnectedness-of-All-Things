These excerpts offer multifaceted insights into Simone de Beauvoir, her foundational work _The Second Sex_, and her complex relationship with Jean-Paul Sartre and the feminist movement. Key themes include: Beauvoir's self-identification as a literary writer rather than a philosopher despite her profound philosophical contributions; the significant, yet often understated, mutual influence between Beauvoir and Sartre; Beauvoir's critique of biological determinism and essentialist notions of "woman-identity" and motherhood; the roots of radical feminism in _The Second Sex_; Beauvoir's complex personal relationships, particularly her early desires for fusion with the Other and her later relationships with younger women; and the challenges faced by her work in being recognized for its philosophical depth, especially in the English-speaking academic world.

**Key Themes and Important Ideas:**

1. **Beauvoir's Self-Perception and Philosophical Identity:** Beauvoir consistently describes herself as a literary writer rather than a philosopher, despite her acknowledged influence on philosophical thought. This self-definition is rooted in her understanding of a "philosopher" as someone who builds a "great system" like Descartes, Hegel, or Sartre.

	- **Quote:** "Sartre was a philosopher, and me, I am not; and I never really wanted to be a philosopher... I was interested in novels, in memoirs, in essays such as The Second Sex. But this is not philosophy."
	- She views _The Second Sex_ and _Ethics of Ambiguity_ as "essays" rather than systematic philosophy.
	- This self-perception is often at odds with how her work, particularly _The Second Sex_, is received and analyzed, especially by American philosophers who view it as deeply philosophical, even metaphysical.

2. **The Influence and Relationship with Jean-Paul Sartre:** While Beauvoir asserts that Sartre's influence was primarily on her philosophical plane because he _was_ a philosopher, the excerpts reveal a more reciprocal and complex relationship.

	- Beauvoir claims _Being and Nothingness_ was the "only important influence on The Second Sex" philosophically.
	- However, she details significant instances where she critically reviewed Sartre's work and he made changes based on her feedback, highlighting a mutual intellectual exchange and respect ("Each one criticizing the other on the basis of that which he knew the other wanted to do").
	- Beauvoir suggests she may have influenced Sartre's later interest in childhood development, as seen in _The Words_, given her own greater interest in the topic.
	- She attributes the idea for _The Second Sex_ partially to Sartre's suggestion that she explain "what it is to be a woman" when she initially intended to write solely about herself.
	- Beauvoir explicitly states that her ideas on women and the concept of the Other (in relation to women) were _her own creation_, not derived from Sartre, who she claims was not very interested in the "woman question."
	- Their close personal and intellectual relationship for fifty years is highlighted, although Beauvoir rejects the "masculine point of view" and "phallocratic prejudice" that suggests a woman's work is merely a reflection of the man she lives with.
	- Their differences in attitude towards philosophy, literature, and the role of passion versus will are noted, though Beauvoir argues Sartre's philosophy (specifically _Being and Nothingness_) _did_ include discussion of the body.

3. **The Genesis and Core Ideas of _The Second Sex_**: _The Second Sex_ is presented as a groundbreaking work, deeply rooted in Beauvoir's own reflections and experience of being a woman.

	- Beauvoir wrote the book "in a very spontaneous manner, as one response to the questions that I asked myself, that I began to ask myself about the fact of being a woman."
	- While acknowledging reading Virginia Woolf (particularly _A Room of One's Own_), she states she was not significantly influenced by anyone in particular, or perhaps influenced by "everyone" through her stance towards the world and literature.
	- She was influenced by antagonists like Montherlant and Lawrence in understanding and critiquing their detestable views of women.
	- The central idea of _The Second Sex_, as repeatedly affirmed by Beauvoir, is her social constructionist view: **"one is not born a woman, but rather becomes one."** This directly challenges biological and essentialist definitions of womanhood.
	- **Quote:** "It's not something given. There is a presence to the world, which is the presence which defines man, who is defined by his presence to the world, his consciousness and not a nature that grants him a priori certain characteristics. That's a gross error to have translated it in that way [referring to a mistranslation of 'la realit√© humaine' as 'the real nature of man']."
	- She views "woman-identity" based on a supposed "feminine nature" as falling into a "masculine trap of wanting to enclose us in our differences."
	- She argues against the idea that biological difference is the _foundation_ of sociological difference, although biological difference exists.
	- _The Second Sex_ is described as providing a crucial "theoretical foundation" for understanding women's situation.
	- Beauvoir's critique of traditional views on motherhood is central to _The Second Sex_. She argues that while motherhood itself isn't inherently negative, the social _institution_ of motherhood in Western civilization is a "trap for women" because it enslaves them to the home, husband, and man.
	- She differentiates her position from those who want to eliminate motherhood biologically (like Shulamith Firestone), instead focusing on changing the social conditions under which maternity is lived.
	- Beauvoir asserts that _The Second Sex_ still expresses a relevant feminist position today, with only minor outdated references.

4. **Motherhood and the Challenge of Balancing Work and Family:** The excerpts highlight the ongoing debate about motherhood within feminism and Beauvoir's perspective on the difficulties women face.

	- Beauvoir acknowledges that while it is _possible_ for some women, particularly privileged ones with resources, to be mothers and also "transcendent" (have careers and pursue their own goals), it is "very difficult" for the majority of women, especially those without money or in unrewarding work.
	- She notes that women often feel "split" between their roles as mothers and workers.
	- The concept of "enslaved motherhood" is discussed as a reality for many women.
	- The author, Margaret Simons, reflects on her own choice not to be a mother and argues for a feminist maternal ethic that allows women to choose not to mother without losing self-respect. She suggests finding ways to express nurturing values through other social relationships.

5. **Critique of Essentialism and Biological Determinism:** Beauvoir is presented as a strong opponent of essentialist views that define women based on biological characteristics.

	- She criticizes feminist movements, both French and American, that exalt menstruation, maternity, or the female body as the center of a woman's culture, viewing this as a form of "crazy narcissism" that plays into the masculine trap of defining women by their differences.
	- Her position is rooted in her social constructivism: women's situation and identity are primarily shaped by civilization and social forces, not biology.
	- She rejects the idea of a fixed "woman's nature" or "feminine nature."

6. **"Masculinist" Critiques of Beauvoir and the Value of Oppression:** The excerpts address the criticism that Beauvoir's feminism is "masculinist" due to her emphasis on individual achievement and "transcendence."

	- Beauvoir accepts some values associated with the "masculine" public sphere (self-assertion, individual achievement) but rejects those that denigrate women, promote male dominance, or turn relationships into battlegrounds.
	- She believes that women, due to their situation of oppression, avoid certain "masculine faults" like excessive emulation, seriousness, and valuing superficial symbols of status ("male tinware"). However, she does not wish for women to remain oppressed to retain these qualities.
	- She suggests men could benefit from sharing some of these "feminine qualities that result from oppression," such as patience, sympathy, and irony.
	- Beauvoir sees women's shared situation of oppression as creating a unity, although she believes isolation can also be a source of strength (leading to inner life and self-reliance).

7. **The Problem of the Other and Reciprocity:** Beauvoir's understanding of the relationship between self and Other is discussed, originating in her early diaries and elaborated in _The Second Sex_.

	- Her early diaries reveal a struggle with loneliness and a desire for fusion with the Other, contrasting with later expressions of autonomy.
	- The desire for abdication of the self in fusion is presented as a "central moral problem for women," linked to defining oneself in others' terms (an idea later explored by Carol Gilligan).
	- Beauvoir explicitly rejects the master/slave dialectic in human relationships, advocating for **reciprocity** where individuals recognize each other as both subject and object.
	- **Quote:** "I believe that both parties must consider each other reciprocally as subjects. I do not think that women should take up power against men, to avoid what men did against women. I think that they must find a reciprocity."
	- She applies this to gender relations, arguing that neither sex should reduce the Other to an object.

8. **Roots of Radical Feminism in _The Second Sex_**: The excerpts argue for _The Second Sex_ as a foundational text for radical feminism.

	- Prominent radical feminists like Kate Millett and Shulamith Firestone acknowledged its influence.
	- Beauvoir's critique of historical materialism (Marxism) and psychoanalysis (Freud) for their male-centered perspectives and reductionism is highlighted. She argued that both failed to adequately account for the unique situation and experience of women.
	- Her rejection of essentialist reductionism and her social constructionism (**"one is not born, but rather becomes a woman"**) are seen as key contributions to radical feminist thought.
	- Beauvoir's challenge to normative female heterosexuality and her analysis of male fear and hatred of women as stemming from anxieties about their own contingency (birth, embodiment, death) are presented as anticipating later radical feminist critiques.
	- Her methodology, moving from cultural critique to phenomenological description of women's lived experience ("Lived Experience" is the title of Volume 2), is seen as laying the groundwork for women's studies.

9. **Challenges to Beauvoir's Reception and Translation:** The excerpts point out how Beauvoir's work has been misinterpreted, overlooked, or presented inaccurately, particularly in the English-speaking world.

	- Early academic texts (like Robert Solomon's) treated her work superficially, dismissed her as merely Sartre's follower, or misinterpreted key passages (like the "bad faith" quote, presented out of context).
	- Significant portions of _The Second Sex_ (like the historical analysis of marriage and women's lives) were omitted or mistranslated in the first English edition, which Beauvoir herself lamented and hoped would be corrected in a new translation.
	- Beauvoir's denial of being a philosopher contributed to her marginalization in philosophical canons, despite her significant contributions to existentialism and feminism.

10. **Early Philosophical Development and Influences:** Beauvoir's 1927 diary is presented as a crucial source for understanding her early philosophical questions and influences predating her relationship with Sartre.

	- The diary reveals her early interest in becoming a philosopher, her search for direction, and a struggle with themes of despair and the meaninglessness of existence (anticipating Sartrean concepts like the "void").
	- Early influences noted in the diary include German philosophers (Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Eucken) and French intellectual traditions (Alain, Val√©ry, Bergson, Lagneau, Maine de Biran, Renouvier).
	- Henri Bergson's influence is specifically highlighted, particularly his concepts of "presence," "becoming," and the importance of time consciousness and memory in shaping identity. Beauvoir's famous line "one is not born a woman, but becomes one" uses Bergson's term "devient" (becomes).
	- The diary also shows Beauvoir's early engagement with Maurice Merleau-Ponty, revealing philosophical differences and her defense of emotion, sensibility, and embodied experience against his focus on pure reason and attempts to draw her back to Catholicism. Their interactions reveal a gendered context to their philosophical debates.

11. **Personal Relationships and the "Female World":** The excerpts provide insight into Beauvoir's personal life and relationships, challenging conventional narratives.

	- Her attraction to women and engagement in sexual relationships with female students (Olga, Jos√©, Natasha, Louise V√©drine, Sorokine) are discussed based on her diaries and letters, suggesting that her "woman's heart" was rooted in a "female world of love and ritual" distinct from the male intellectual world she entered.
	- These relationships, particularly the complex trio with Sartre and Olga, are presented as influential in her life and work (e.g., _She Came to Stay_).
	- Beauvoir's desire for fusion with the Other, rooted in her early life and relationships (like her cousin Jacques), is presented as a recurring theme and a "problem faced by many women."
	- Her refusal to marry Sartre despite his proposal is presented as a key decision demonstrating her commitment to independence and feminism.

**Conclusion:**

The excerpts from Simons' book provide a valuable and nuanced portrait of Simone de Beauvoir, emphasizing her intellectual autonomy and her groundbreaking contributions to feminist thought, particularly through _The Second Sex_. They highlight the complexity of her relationship with Sartre, the depth of her early philosophical inquiries, and her enduring critique of essentialism and oppressive social institutions. The difficulties her work faced in achieving full recognition, especially its philosophical significance, underscore the ongoing need for careful study and accurate translation of her texts. Beauvoir emerges not just as a chronicler of women's oppression but as a powerful thinker who challenged fundamental philosophical assumptions and provided a theoretical basis for radical feminist critiques that continue to resonate today.
