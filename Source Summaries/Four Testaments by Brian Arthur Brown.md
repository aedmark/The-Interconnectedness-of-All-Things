**Exploring the Four Testaments: An Introduction to Brian Arthur Brown's Vision**

Right from the start, this book jumps into something super relevant for our times. It recognizes that our world is more connected than ever, thanks to instant communication. This interconnectedness shows us all the good _and_ the not-so-good things happening around the globe, including religious misunderstandings and even violence. The big idea here is that we really need to learn how to live together peacefully, respectfully, and openly. And to do that, a key step is understanding each other better.

That's where Brian Arthur Brown's project comes in. It makes it invitingly easy for curious readers to engage with some truly monumental religious classics. This particular volume, _Four Testaments_, brings together the Tao Te Ching, the Analects, the Dhammapada, and the Bhagavad Gita, which are foundational scriptures for Taoism, Confucianism, Buddhism, and Hinduism, respectively. It's important to note that the book doesn't just give you snippets or quotes; it actually provides the full texts of these works, asking the reader to engage with each one from beginning to end.

**Why Bring These Different Texts Together?**

Now, you might wonder, "What do these very different texts have to do with each other?" That's a fair question, and some people might find their unexpected pairing under one cover a bit unsettling. But here's where the magic happens: putting them side-by-side makes it possible, maybe even unavoidable, to read them together. You're invited to browse through them, flip back and forth, and let your imagination bring them together. It's not about rushing to find easy answers or quotable wisdom; it's about undertaking a larger, longer, and deeper task of learning by thinking across these Indian and Chinese traditions.

This isn't the first time classic religious texts have been collected (you might think of the _Sacred Books of the East_ project from the 19th century), but it's a task worth revisiting in every age. Brown and his team are commended for their contribution to interreligious understanding in a way that feels fresh and enduring.

**Beyond the Four: The Vital Role of Zoroastrianism**

While four-fifths of the book focuses on the Tao Te Ching, Analects, Dhammapada, and Bhagavad Gita, there's a significant "subtext" running through it: the Zoroastrian tradition. In fact, Zoroastrianism plays such a significant role that it's presented as a crucial link between these Eastern texts, and even between Eastern and Western texts. The book suggests that Zoroastrianism is an iteration of ancient Vedic lore.

The idea is that there was a dramatic spiritual stirring around the Silk Route in the early sixth century BCE, possibly kicked off by the Persian prophet Zoroaster. This stirring might have influenced developments in China, leading to Taoism and, as an "equal and opposite reaction," Confucianism. In India, the response was different, beginning with Buddhism as a positive development, followed by a reform that renewed Hinduism. These scriptures reflect developments that happened within a single century among a large part of the world's population.

Zoroastrianism is presented as potentially the single "revelation" with the greatest impact in this volume, serving as a Vedic link not just between the four Eastern traditions but also connecting back to the three Western traditions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) discussed in Brown's previous volume. It suggests that the linkage between these major world religions, and even many traditional religions, might stem from a deep, common source, like a "subterranean aquifer".

This exploration also touches on the relationship between monotheism (belief in one God) and monism (the view that reality is ultimately one). Is monotheism a step towards monism, or do they represent different understandings? The book invites you to consider where the line is, or if there's a dynamic continuum between them. Lately, people are even identifying as both Jews and Buddhists, showing how fluid religion can be.

**A Glimpse at the Texts and Their Connections**

The book presents the four main Eastern testaments in what appears to be chronological order. Interestingly, they also seem to follow a kind of developmental arc in meaning.

- The **Tao Te Ching** is described as sometimes mysterious and enigmatic, like a trip to the planetarium for a view of the universe. It talks about concepts like "nonaction" (wu wei), which is about acting without seeking personal gain or desire for results.
- The **Analects** of Confucius, introduced by Rabbi Mates-Muchin using phrases that sound a bit Taoist, seem to raise questions about traditional morality that Buddhism later addresses. It's presented as a survival manual focusing on human experience and behavior, showing what works and is worthy of emulation. Chapters offer insights into desired virtues, avoiding unwanted practices, achieving happiness through willpower, and proper conduct in various roles.
- The **Dhammapada** is portrayed as addressing questions raised by the Analects. It's seen as representing the roots of Buddhism in the Theravada tradition. It's likened to a GPS, centering us in our current situation. Its teachings are summarized as living ethically, disciplining the mind, being without hatred, being respectful, avoiding evil deeds, being nonviolent, and curbing anger. Interestingly, some scholars think parts of the Dhammapada might even be adapted from earlier poetry or shared teachings. It begins with the idea that "our life is the creation of our mind," which is quite different from the Genesis creation account. Some believe the Dhammapada contains all the core teachings needed to follow the Buddha, much like the Sermon on the Mount for Christians.
- The **Bhagavad Gita** draws the Eastern testaments together. It's seen as a universal guidebook providing step-by-step directions. The book highlights a strong case for a connection between the Gita and the Tao Te Ching, particularly the concept of "altruistic or disinterested action," which seems identical to the Taoist idea of "nonaction". The Gita teaches one to act without regard for the results of action. It also sketches an ideal type, the "person of steady understanding," which can be compared to the "superior man" in the Analects.

The book even points out that these main traditions have some common roots and might enrich each other or at least coexist. For example, the presence of fire sacrifice rituals in the post-exilic book of Leviticus is seen as a radical departure from earlier Hebrew practices and potentially influenced by Zoroastrian priestly contacts during the Babylonian Exile. Nehemiah, the Jewish cup-bearer for a Zoroastrian monarch, is suggested to have been an authority on Zoroastrian purification rites, and these might have influenced the texts he and Ezra compiled. The book of Job is also presented as a non-Jewish document acquired during the Exile, possibly edited previously by Zoroastrians, showing a one-God understanding that predates later Sassanian dualism. These examples are part of what's called the "Z factor," tentative Z passages in Western scriptures that show Zoroastrian influence.

**The Quest for the "Dead Zee Scrolls"**

Adding another layer of intrigue, the book introduces the search for the missing parts of the Zoroastrian Avesta scriptures, playfully nicknamed the "Dead Zee Scrolls". This quest is compared to the search for the "Q" source behind the Christian Gospels or the actual Dead Sea Scrolls, which revolutionized our understanding of ancient Judaism and Christianity.

The Avesta we have today is estimated to be only about 20 percent of the original. Pieces of the jigsaw puzzle have been found, like prayers written on ox-hide scrolls in gold letters, copies translated into multiple languages, and fragments found in places like Dunhuang. The missing parts, particularly the fifteen early sutras presumed to have been before the Yasna, are seen as a potential "mother lode" of information.

Finding these lost texts could be like an iceberg rolling over, causing a spiritual "tsunami" that impacts affected religious communities. It could provide insights into Zoroastrianism's foundational origins and its role as a stimulus for the religious developments of the Axial Age along the Silk Route. It might illuminate the early development of Eastern texts like Taoist, Hindu, and Buddhist examples, which developed in the wake of Zoroaster. The book points to places like caves and other locations along the Silk Road as prime spots to look for these lost scriptures.

The search for these scrolls isn't just about finding old paper; it's about potentially recovering ideas that didn't make it into the final, edited versions of religious texts we have today. Studying the actual ancient texts and how they were later interpreted helps us better understand their original meaning.

**Reciprocal Illumination and Turning Strangers into Family**

One powerful idea explored is "reciprocal illumination". This is the fascinating phenomenon where studying another religious tradition doesn't just help you understand _that_ tradition better, but it also helps you understand _your own_ tradition better. Gandhi experienced this, noting that studying other religions deepened his faith and understanding of Hindu scriptures. The book suggests comparing the Confucian "superior man" and the Bhagavad Gita's "person of steady understanding" as an example of how these ideal types can illuminate each other.

Ultimately, by inviting readers to read these different scriptures and exploring the historical connections between them, the book encourages us to see the significant commonalities shared by the world's major religious traditions. While acknowledging that it's impossible to reconcile all the distinct claims (like rebirth vs. escaping the flesh, or Jesus as the Son of God vs. Krishna as an incarnation), we can choose to be respectful and appreciative of the wisdom found in these texts. This process helps turn strangers into a kind of family, recognizing shared roots and perspectives.

**Looking Ahead: Questions to Explore Further**

This briefing document just scratches the surface! Here are some ideas and questions that might pique your interest and encourage you to explore the book's themes more deeply:

1. **The Silk Route Stirring:** The book suggests a powerful spiritual awakening along the Silk Route around the 6th century BCE, possibly linked to Zoroaster. How did these ideas travel? What specific historical evidence exists beyond the scriptures themselves to show the connections between Persian, Chinese, and Indian developments during the Axial Age?
2. **Monism and Monotheism Today:** The book touches on the dynamic between monotheism and monism. In our modern world, with growing interest in Eastern philosophies and interconnectedness, how might this ancient tension continue to play out in people's personal faith journeys and interfaith dialogue?
3. **Applying Ancient Wisdom:** Concepts like "non-action" from the Tao Te Ching and "unattached action" from the Bhagavad Gita, or the Confucian emphasis on self-cultivation and propriety, are presented. How can these ancient ideas be practically applied to navigate the complexities of modern life, work, and relationships?
4. **The "Z Factor" Hunt:** The idea of finding Zoroastrian influence (the "Z factor") in Western scriptures is intriguing. Where else, beyond the examples given (creation stories, fire sacrifice, angels, Job), might researchers look for potential Z passages or concepts in Jewish, Christian, or Muslim texts?
5. **The Thrill of Discovery:** The quest for the "Dead Zee Scrolls" highlights the potential impact of finding lost texts. What other lost scriptures or versions of texts from _any_ religious tradition might be waiting to be discovered, and what revolutionary insights could they offer about the history and evolution of religious ideas?
6. **Reciprocal Illumination in Action:** How can you actively apply the principle of reciprocal illumination in your own life? How can learning about a tradition different from your own help you understand your beliefs and practices better, and foster greater empathy for others?
7. **The "Final Testament":** The book mentions the idea that the "Final Testament is the testament that was written in the hearts and minds of the followers," sometimes only recoverable through material culture. What examples of material culture (art, architecture, artifacts, music) can you think of that might reveal aspects of religious belief and practice not explicitly detailed in written scriptures?

_Four Testaments_ is presented not just as an academic work, but as something that can be a valuable resource for understanding our interconnected world and finding ways to live together in peace. It's a call to be better readers, to engage deeply with these texts, and to appreciate the rich tapestry of human spirituality across the East and West.
