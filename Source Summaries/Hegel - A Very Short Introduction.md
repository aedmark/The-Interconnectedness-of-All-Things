First off, why bother with Hegel? Well, he's a giant! Peter Singer states that _no_ philosopher of the 19th or 20th centuries has had as much impact on the world as Hegel, possibly with the exception of Karl Marx, who himself was heavily influenced by Hegel. The intellectual and political landscape of the last 150 years wouldn't be the same without him. So, understanding Hegel is important not just for his own sake, but for understanding a huge chunk of modern history and thought.

This book, however, doesn't try to cover _everything_ Hegel ever wrote. That would be quite a feat for a _very short_ introduction! For instance, it doesn't delve into his lectures on Aesthetics, the History of Philosophy, or the Philosophy of Religion, except when they connect with other works discussed. It also doesn't give a detailed account of his _Science of Logic_, which Hegel considered a key work, because it's just too long and abstract for this kind of book, although it does try to give you a sense of its aim, method, and flavour.

So, what _does_ it focus on to make Hegel accessible? It takes a "gentlest possible approach route", starting with what many consider his greatest work, _The Phenomenology of Mind_ (sometimes called _Spirit_). Karl Marx even called this book "the true birthplace and secret of Hegel’s philosophy".

**Peeking into the Phenomenology of Mind**

The _Phenomenology of Mind_ is dense – about 750 pages of, well, challenging prose. But at its heart, it's a journey. The word "phenomenology" itself means the science of phenomena, or things as they appear to us, as opposed to their "being" or "thing in itself". Think about the moon – it appears as a small crescent in the sky, but it's really a massive sphere of rock. Phenomenology studies how things _appear_.

A "phenomenology of mind," then, is the study of how mind appears. But here's the Hegelian twist: when mind studies how it appears to us, it's actually studying how it appears _to itself_. So, Hegel's _Phenomenology of Mind_ traces the development of different forms of consciousness, looking at each one from its own perspective and showing how simpler, more limited forms naturally evolve into more complete ones. This whole journey is about the development of consciousness towards a state he calls "absolute knowledge".

The book explains that Hegel starts the _Phenomenology_ by grappling with the problem of knowledge itself. Philosophy aims for "actual knowledge of what truly is," which Hegel also calls "the absolute". But before claiming to know what truly is, shouldn't we think about _how_ we know reality?. Hegel points out that knowing is often seen like using an instrument to grasp truth, but what if the instrument (our mind) alters reality when we use it?. Even if knowledge is more like a medium, we're still seeing reality _through_ that medium, not reality itself. This leads to skeptical worries.

Can we just figure out the distortion and subtract it, like calculating how water makes a stick look bent?. Hegel says no; knowing isn't like seeing, and this simple escape isn't available.

The _Phenomenology_ then examines different stages of consciousness. It starts with "sense-certainty," the idea that true knowledge comes from directly experiencing individual things here and now. But Hegel shows this isn't enough; our attempts to describe this immediate knowledge using language bring in universal concepts ("this," "here," "now" apply to many different things and moments), showing that even basic knowledge involves our mind actively structuring what we experience. Language itself relies on universal categories, proving the impossibility of knowing purely particular sense-experiences without a conceptual scheme.

As consciousness develops, it moves beyond passively receiving data. It actively tries to create unity and coherence from sense-experience, using concepts like those in physics (gravity, force). Hegel argues that at this stage, consciousness is, in a way, trying to understand its _own_ creations. It has itself as its object, which means it's reached the point of being latent self-consciousness. The second part of the _Phenomenology_ then focuses on the development of this latent self-consciousness into full self-consciousness.

Many sections of the _Phenomenology_ are skipped in this short introduction, some because they are obscure or tedious, others because they cover topics like critiques of hedonism, Kant's ethics, or romantic sentimentality. More unusual topics also appear, such as analyses of physiognomy and phrenology (which Hegel rejects because mind isn't tied to material things like faces or skulls) and Adam Smith's laissez-faire economics (which Hegel criticizes for preventing individuals from seeing themselves as part of a community by encouraging self-interest).

All these diverse topics are woven into the path mind must take to reach absolute knowledge. This development involves consciousness working on and changing the world, both intellectually and practically.

**Connecting Phenomenology to History and Society**

Interestingly, the book notes similarities between the _Phenomenology_ and Hegel's later works, _The Philosophy of History_ and _The Philosophy of Right_. Hegel sees all of human history as the development of mind. Historical periods and elements of the organic community described in the _Philosophy of Right_ are treated as stages in the progress of mind towards freedom.

However, there are differences too. In the _Phenomenology_, Hegel is much more abstract. He doesn't name specific countries, dates, events, or people. It's as if the process of mind's development would happen the same way regardless of specific circumstances, almost as if it could unfold on Mars.

Another key difference is the culmination. While _The Philosophy of History_ and _The Philosophy of Right_ seem to lead towards a state resembling the Prussian monarchy of Hegel's time, the _Phenomenology_ doesn't mention this. The sections parallel to the _Philosophy of History_ end with the French Revolution. The French Revolution is seen as a climax representing mind in a state of absolute freedom, aware of its power to shape the world. However, this abstract freedom leads to terror and death, and the _Phenomenology_ then moves to more abstract stages like Kantian morality, religion, and finally, absolute knowledge through philosophy. The book suggests a possible explanation for the absence of the Prussian state in the _Phenomenology_ is that Hegel wrote it while in Jena, during the Napoleonic Wars, when the future of German states was uncertain, not yet in Prussia. This difference has led some to believe Hegel compromised his true views in later works to please political authorities.

A third difference is the stated goal. The _Philosophy of History_ presents world history as the progress of the consciousness of _freedom_. The _Phenomenology_ focuses on development towards _absolute knowledge_. Taking these in their ordinary senses, they seem incompatible – can't you be knowledgeable but unfree, or free but ignorant?. But, as the book warns, we must be careful not to take Hegel's terms in their ordinary senses. The goal of the _Phenomenology_, absolute knowledge, is linked to the goal of history, consciousness of freedom.

**Absolute Knowledge and Idealism**

So, what _is_ absolute knowledge? Hegel calls self-knowledge "absolute knowledge," and it's tied to his concept of freedom. But isn't self-knowledge just one part of knowledge, alongside sciences like physics and astronomy?. The book clarifies two misconceptions here. First, by "absolute knowledge," Hegel doesn't mean knowing _everything_. He means knowing the world _as it really is_, contrasting it with mere appearances. His goal wasn't to increase scientific facts, but to show how _real_ knowledge is possible.

The second misconception requires understanding Hegel's position on reality: he was an "absolute idealist". Philosophical idealism, unlike the everyday meaning of having lofty ideals, means that ultimate reality is constituted by ideas, minds, thoughts, or consciousness. This is opposed to materialism, which holds that ultimate reality is material.

Hegel believes ultimate reality is mind, and he argues the _Phenomenology_ demonstrates this. Efforts to know an objective reality independent of mind fail. Raw sense data are meaningless until mind structures them with concepts. What we call "material objects" aren't independent things but constructs involving concepts like 'property' and 'substance'. At the stage of self-consciousness, mind sees scientific laws as its own creations and begins to shape the world practically, not just intellectually, by working on objects according to its own ideas. It also starts shaping its social world. The journey shows that mind, in trying to know reality, is actually watching itself _construct_ reality. Hegel argues that only with this view of reality as mind's creation can he show that genuine knowledge is possible.

**Puzzles and Criticisms**

Hegel's ideas are bold, but they raise questions. One big question concerns his idealism. Even if we grant that mind structures experience and shapes the world practically, doesn't the idea of "raw information" from the senses or Michelangelo needing "marble in the first place" suggest something exists independently of mind?. This leads back to Kant's idea of an unknowable "thing-in-itself" – and the book asks if Hegel truly shows we can do without it.

Another puzzle also stems from his idealism. If ultimate reality is mind, but there are countless individual minds with different thoughts, does that mean there are countless different realities?. Hegel rejects this subjective idealism. He calls his view _absolute_ idealism because he believes there's only _one_ reality, meaning there's ultimately only one mind.

This brings us back to a key question: what does Hegel mean by "mind" if it's singular and ultimate reality?. It seems he means a collective or universal mind. The book asks if "spirit" might have been a better translation, with its religious connotations, and if this universal mind should be seen as Hegel's conception of God.

The book explores this, noting the uncertainties. On one hand, the idea of a collective or universal mind is needed to avoid subjective idealism and to support his vision of mind seeing all reality as its own creation. If there are millions of distinct minds, no single one could see most of reality as its own creation. This suggests interpreting Hegel's "mind" as a cosmic consciousness, not a separate God, but perhaps something closer to Eastern philosophies where All is One.

On the other hand, Hegel saw himself as a defender of reason. Can this be reconciled with cosmic consciousness?. Maybe by emphasizing how social consciousness necessarily is. From the beginning of the _Phenomenology_, Hegel stresses that knowledge requires communication through language, implying consciousness isn't entirely independent. Minds need to interact to develop self-consciousness. Ultimately, freedom and self-understanding are found in a rationally organized community. This perspective suggests that minds aren't isolated units linked by chance, but fundamentally social.

**Hegel's State and Freedom: A Puzzling Harmony?**

A major puzzle the book tackles is how Hegel, who saw freedom as the goal of history, could suggest this goal was reached in the autocratic Prussian state of his time. Was he just trying to please his rulers?. Was he a precursor to totalitarianism, as critics like Karl Popper suggested?.

The book argues that Hegel's ideal rational state described in the _Philosophy of Right_ wasn't simply a description of Prussia then. There were similarities, but also significant differences. For example, Hegel's ideal constitutional monarch had limited power compared to Frederick William III, Prussia lacked a functioning parliament while Hegel described a legislature (even if limited), and Hegel supported greater freedom of expression (within limits) than was allowed by the strict censorship under the Carlsbad decrees of 1819. He also advocated for trial by jury, which didn't exist in Prussia at the time. These differences suggest Hegel wasn't just tailoring his philosophy to the king.

However, the book acknowledges that Hegel was _not_ a liberal in the modern sense. He rejected popular voting and placed restrictions on free speech. He even opposed the English Reform Bill, which expanded voting rights (though still excluded most adults).

Given his concept of freedom, this isn't surprising. Hegel likely wouldn't see popular suffrage as leading to true freedom, perhaps thinking people would just vote based on private interests, not rational choices for the community [7, see also section on Organic Community].

Despite the differences from Prussia, the book notes the extravagant language Hegel used about the state and his idea that true freedom is found in rational choices can be misused for totalitarian ends. But it insists this is a _misuse_. Hegel defended the rule of law, insisted laws must be known, and attacked those who favored "might makes right". This stance is awkward for someone supposedly building a totalitarian state with secret police and dictatorial power.

Hegel was serious about reason, perhaps more than many of us are today. When he spoke of a "rational state," he meant something objective and specific. It had to be a state that individuals _chose_ to obey and support because they genuinely agreed with its rational principles and found their satisfaction in being part of it. For Hegel, a rational state could never treat citizens like Nazi or Stalinist states did – that would be a contradiction. The conflict between state interests and individual rights disappears in Hegel's rational state because their interests are in harmony.

The book concludes that while Hegel wasn't advocating totalitarianism, he might have been extraordinarily optimistic about achieving such harmony between individuals and the state. Or, perhaps, the state he described, while differing from Prussia, didn't differ _radically_ enough. The most likely explanation offered is that Hegel was either too conservative or too cautious to advocate for a truly radical departure from the political system he lived under, perhaps muting the more radical implications of his philosophy to avoid trouble with the rulers.

**Aftermath and Legacy**

After Hegel's death, his followers split. The "Right Hegelians" were more orthodox and conservative, accepting his views on religion and the Prussian state. They produced no major thinkers and faded away.

The "Young Hegelians" or "Left Hegelians" were a radical group, including figures like Karl Marx. They saw Hegel's philosophy as a call for a better, rationally organized, genuinely free world that hadn't yet arrived. They believed Hegel hadn't fully followed through on the radical implications of his own ideas, much like Hegel thought Kant hadn't fully pushed the implications of his philosophy regarding the "thing-in-itself".

The Young Hegelians saw this ideal world as a "dialectical necessity" that would emerge to resolve the conflicts of their time. Initially, they focused on religion as an obstacle, developing Hegel's idea of "unhappy consciousness" from the _Phenomenology_. They argued religion is a form of alienation: humans create God, attribute their best qualities to this creation (knowledge, goodness, power), then see themselves as inferior by comparison. To restore human power, people just need to realize _they_ are the highest divinity. Two Young Hegelians, including David Friedrich Strauss (author of _Life of Jesus_), wrote influential books on this.

**Wrapping Up**

So, Peter Singer's "Hegel: A Very Short Introduction" is your gateway into the core ideas of this immensely influential, albeit difficult, philosopher. It navigates key works like the _Phenomenology of Mind_, _Philosophy of Right_, and _Philosophy of History_, explaining Hegel's concepts of freedom, the organic community, absolute idealism, and absolute knowledge. It bravely confronts the puzzle of Hegel's apparent support for the Prussian state and addresses criticisms by showing the nuances of his ideal state and his defense of reason and law, even while acknowledging potential issues with his optimism or caution. It finishes by touching upon the radical legacy of the Young Hegelians who pushed his ideas in new directions.

**Further Ideas and Questions to Explore:**

Reading this introduction might spark some questions and lead you to dig deeper! For example:

- If absolute knowledge is self-knowledge of mind as the creator of reality, does that mean individual consciousness is absorbed into a universal mind? How does Hegel's emphasis on the social nature of consciousness relate to the idea of a single, ultimate mind?
- The book mentions the dialectical method briefly. While it avoids deep technical details, it notes Marx found the rational part of it useful. What exactly _is_ this dialectical method with its "simple rhythm," and how does it work in Hegel's philosophy?
- Hegel saw history as the necessary development of mind towards freedom. How does this idea of historical necessity square with individual free will?
- The Young Hegelians took Hegel's philosophy as a demand for a better world. What specific changes did they advocate for, beyond their critique of religion? How did Marx develop his own revolutionary ideas from Hegel's philosophy?
- The book touches on Hegel's early radical religious views compared to his later apparent Lutheranism. How did his philosophical ideas about Spirit and Absolute Knowledge relate to his personal religious beliefs?

Getting a grasp on Hegel is challenging, but the journey is rewarding, revealing a thinker whose ideas continue to shape how we think about knowledge, history, freedom, and the relationship between the individual and society.
