At its heart, "The Anatomy of Bloom" by Alistair Heys sets out to dissect the key concepts of the influential literary critic Harold Bloom. The book's preface opens with a thought-provoking quote about striving for knowledge and the door to understanding being intended "only for you," hinting at the deeply personal and individualistic nature of the quest for insight that Bloom often embodies. Heys believes that the very core of Bloom's work, particularly his famous concept of the anxiety of influence, is built upon a foundational religious prohibition: the Second Commandment, which forbids making idols or bowing down to other gods. This seemingly simple connection is just the tip of the iceberg, as Heys reveals the intricate religious and cultural roots embedded within Bloom's literary theories.

Heys argues that Bloom's intellectual landscape is shaped by a fascinating blend of Jewish cultural background and the pervasive American-Protestant culture he navigated as an academic. These two distinct "codes of thought" are shown to replicate themselves in Bloom's sophisticated Gnostic theories and readings across various topics, including his idea of the "American Religion".

Let's explore some of these foundational influences and how they manifest in Bloom's concepts, as discussed by Heys:

**The Deep Jewish Roots**

Heys contends that the "inescapably Jewish 'thou shalt not'" of the Second Commandment is a major force lurking behind Bloom's conception of the anxiety of influence. This commandment forbids the creation of idols or images of God. Bloom himself noted that an "imageless God had made humankind in His own image, and then had prohibited human emulation in image-making". Heys sees the competitive, "readerly acquisitiveness" associated with the spirit of Protestant Capitalism as central to Bloom's genius, but also highlights an "agonistic reading of the Second Commandment" as a basic psychological ban underpinning influence anxiety.

The book delves into Bloom's engagement with Jewish tradition, particularly through his controversial work, "The Book of J". In this book, Bloom argues that the earliest part of Genesis was written by a secular genius, the "J-Writer," and that Judaism began as poetic tales later redacted into religious forms. Bloom provocatively suggests that when script becomes Scripture, reading is "numbed by taboo and inhibition". He champions the "irascible warrior-god" version of Yahweh found in J, seeing it as a dynamic deity who interacts directly with characters, even breaking the Second Commandment by being depicted as a "theomorphic man". This contrasts with later, more redacted versions of God in the Hebrew Bible.

Bloom's own Jewish identity, particularly as a post-Holocaust Jew, is presented by Heys as profoundly impacting his views. Heys argues that Bloom's belief in the orthodox Jewish covenant was severely undermined by the Holocaust, leading him to find an answer in a personal, American "religion of Gnosis". Bloom laments that Jews are "no longer a text-obsessed people", yet his own life is characterized by an intense obsession with reading. Heys notes Bloom's identification with obscure Jewish figures like the Kabbalist Isaac Luria and the Gnostic Valentinus. Bloom even draws parallels between the Jews becoming "a religion become a people" and the New England "Yankees" as "once a religion but now a people". The concept of the Jewish "Galut" or Diaspora and its accompanying anxieties is also linked to literary anxiety. Heys argues that while Bloom claims his reading practice is unconnected to any social group, he tends to identify with authors from Jewish and Protestant backgrounds.

- **Further thought:** How does Bloom's personal experience of the Holocaust and his specific reading of the J-Writer shape his understanding of God and tradition? Can we truly separate a critic's literary theories from their cultural and historical context, especially given Bloom's own background?

**The Pervasive Protestant Ethos**

Heys connects Bloom's ideas to Max Weber's analysis of the Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, highlighting a "Protestant dimension" to Bloom's concept of anxiety. Weber's idea of the "pressing consciousness of sin" and the anxiety for salvation leading to intense, self-disciplined activity resonates with Bloom's portrayal of poets striving for aesthetic salvation. Heys sees this "ascetic temperament" in Bloom's association with figures like Whitman, Stevens, and Wordsworth.

The Calvinist idea of "election" – the belief that salvation is predetermined – is translated by Bloom into an aesthetic realm. In this view, poets are separated into the "elect" (strong) and the "damned" (weak) based on aesthetic strength, with the ultimate prize being "the eternal life of being idolized by future poets as an essential part of the canon of secular scripture". Wordsworth is presented as Bloom's model of aesthetic Election, a "prophet of nature" competing with Milton, the "prophet of Protestantism".

Heys also points to the Protestant idea of the isolated self reading the Bible by its "own inner light," a "Miltonic procedure" that Bloom identifies as essentially "Greek and agonistic". This sense of inwardness is crucial for a writer to impose themselves upon tradition. The concept of _askesis_, or conscious training of psychic powers through self-denial and discipline, is linked to both ancient Greek shamans and the Protestant work ethic, appearing in Bloom's revisionary ratios associated with mind/nature dialectics and metaphor.

- **Further thought:** How does the competitive, "agonistic" struggle for aesthetic "election" compare to the religious concept of predestination? In what ways might the "aloneness of the Protestant self" manifest in the psychological struggles Bloom describes between poets?

**Gnostic Literary Criticism**

Heys argues that Bloom's Jewish and Protestant influences merge in his sophisticated Gnostic theories. For Gnostics, the material world (the Kenoma) was created by an "inept" or "false" Creator-God (the Demiurge), distinct from a true, alien God who is remote and in exile. The Gnostic adept believes they have been "thrown" into this world from a realm of "Fullness" or "Pleroma". Heys notes that Bloom sees Gnosticism as arising among Hellenistic Jews before Christ, initially not as a rebellion against the Genesis Creator-God, but eventually turning into one.

Bloom finds traces of the true, alien God in the form of "poetic flourishes" that evoke the sensation of the sublime in the reader. The Gnostic "spark" or _pneuma_ represents knowledge of one's deepest self, which Bloom connects to Emersonian ideas like "It is God in you that responds to God without". For Bloom, the Demiurge is the God of "natural cycles and repetition" and the "ghastliness of human history", a figure he implicitly rejects in favor of an existential answer to the "death of God" by inventing his "American church of one" based on Gnosis.

Heys highlights the influence of Hans Jonas's work on Gnosticism on Bloom, noting Jonas's comparison of the Gnostic world to modern nihilism and existentialism. Both Jonas and Bloom perceive a sense of "crisis" in the abject condition of war-torn 20th-century humanity, which resonates with the Gnostic view of existence as a crisis. Bloom is moved by the Gnostic existential statement, especially since the traditional Jewish covenant seemed broken by the reality of death camps. While Gnostics believe in a Demiurge and an alien God, existentialists might question the "throw without the thrower". Bloom, however, emphasizes the "facticity" of tradition – the brute contingency of being imprisoned by the influence of early authors like the J-Writer – viewing latecomers as a "Gnostic Tantalus" striving for originality.

Heys suggests that Bloom's Jewish identity is expressed through his "Gnostic literary criticism". Gnosis, for Bloom, is a kind of knowledge that _is_ salvation itself, transforming the knower into God, distinct from rational knowledge or traditional religious knowledge. It's a "metaphysic of pure movement and event" that helps texts "lie against time".

- **Further thought:** How does the Gnostic idea of a false creation and an alien God relate to the poet's struggle against a tyrannical precursor? Is Bloom's "American church of one" truly a form of Gnosis, or a secular appropriation of religious ideas?

**Bloom's Key Theories Through a Religious Lens**

Heys reads Bloom's famous theories through this complex cultural and religious framework:

- **The Anxiety of Influence:** Presented not just as Freudian or psychological rivalry, but as fundamentally linked to the "thou shalt not" of the Second Commandment. It's the dread or angst of the latecomer wrestling with the overpowering presence of a precursor, seeking to clear space for their own voice. This struggle is the core "Bloomian existentialism".
    
- **The Scene of Instruction / Revisionary Ratios:** This framework of six ratios (Clinamen, Tessera, Kenosis, Daemonization, Askesis, Apophrades) is described as a "Jewish allegory that pries into the moment of Protestant creation". It analyzes how a later poet misreads, swerves, completes, empties out, empowers, or clears away the influence of a precursor. These ratios are linked to literary tropes (irony, synecdoche, metonymy, hyperbole, metaphor, metalepsis) and psychological defenses (repression, sublimation). The concept draws on Freudian ideas like the primal scene and Oedipal fantasy, but Bloom redefines it as a "Scene of Voicing" or a "horror-of-origins".
    
- **Agon:** While Bloom sees this as a Greek concept of contest, Heys points out how Bloom finds "agonistic" figures and dynamics within the Hebrew Bible, like Jacob wrestling a "nameless one". The struggle for Yahweh's blessing is seen as a central point in the J-Writer's text. This highlights how Bloom finds his Greek concept echoed within his Jewish sources.
    
- **The Canon:** Bloom sees the canon as a form of "secular scripture". Being elected to the canon is the "eternal life" sought by poets who successfully purge themselves of debilitating influence. He vehemently defends the aesthetic value of high literature against readings focused on social or historical factors. However, Heys argues that Bloom's own choices for the canon are influenced by his identification with Jewish and Protestant authors.
    
- **Facticity:** The "brute contingency" of being "imprisoned" by the authority of early, strong authors like the J-Writer, Shakespeare, and Freud. This is linked to the Gnostic idea of being "thrown" into a world not of one's making.
    
- **Further thought:** How does the concept of "achieved anxiety" translate into the reading experience of a strong poem? Can the "Scene of Instruction" be applied to other creative fields beyond poetry?
    

**Bloom's Critical Approach**

Heys portrays Bloom as an iconoclast, someone who aims to "unmask the creative processes that poets undergo". His approach is characterized by a deep engagement with rhetoric and tropes, often relying on etymology and inverting accepted binaries. While Bloom distances himself from Derrida and deconstruction, Heys finds intellectual kinship in their shared interests and notes that Bloom's early idea was "the reduction of a religious concept to an original poetic formulation," which sounds quite deconstructive.

Bloom's criticism is deeply psychological, drawing heavily on Freud, though Bloom sometimes asserts he is not _just_ Freudian. His focus on the "psyche" and its relationship to the "text" is a key element. He is also seen as existential, with his reading practice serving as a way to reaffirm his "chosen life of reading".

Crucially, Heys argues that Bloom's theories, despite Bloom's insistence on aesthetic autonomy, are "not entirely limited to the intrapoetic reading of poems" and have "extrapoetic overtones" that conform to Judaism and Protestantism. Heys sets out to "contradict" Bloom's claim of finding no inner connection between his reading and any social group, arguing Bloom tends to identify with Jewish and Protestant authors. Heys suggests that Bloomian existentialism "equates to the phenomenology of the canon," where authentic being comes through engaging with canonical literature.

Bloom's relationship with key figures is also explored. Northrop Frye is presented as Bloom's precursor, whose "Christian Platonism" Bloom swerves away from while remaining indebted. Yale colleagues like Hartman, Derrida, and de Man are significant interlocutors, challenging and shaping Bloom's ideas. Heys analyzes Bloom's responses to critiques, such as de Man's argument that language has priority over the subject.

- **Further thought:** If Bloom's criticism is a form of autobiography, how does his life story illuminate his readings of poets? How does Bloom's blend of Greek agon, Jewish theology, Protestant individualism, and Gnostic knowledge create a unique critical methodology?

**Notable Observations and Connections**

Heys sprinkles the text with interesting connections and observations, such as linking Blake's reference to "ragged garments" to Bloom's father being a garment-maker, suggesting a personal resonance behind Bloom's interpretations. He notes Bloom's complex relationship with Wordsworth, identifying him as the first truly "Modern poet" and the "prophet of nature", while also exploring the poet's struggle with Miltonic influence. Shelley is discussed as a Prometheus figure and a key precursor for Yeats. Whitman is presented as an "American Adam" and a source of epicurean and sublime imagery. Stevens is analyzed through Bloom's revisionary ratios, exploring his "crisis-lyric" and struggle for originality.

Heys also highlights specific Bloomian phrases and concepts, like "grief without a name" (linked to nameless divine presence and the resistance to the Word), "something ever more about to be" (linked to the sublime and the Kabbalistic Ein-Sof), and the idea that "change results in death, which is the mother of beauty" (from Stevens).

The author consistently brings the discussion back to the core tension between Bloom's Jewish background and his American-Protestant context. Heys suggests that Bloom's Gnosis offers an alternative to normative Judaism and orthodox Christianity, a "knowledge" that transforms man into God.

- **Further thought:** How do specific literary examples, like Wordsworth's "Tintern Abbey" or Blake's "The Tyger," serve as vehicles for Bloom's complex religious and psychological arguments? What does Bloom mean by "strong literature is sacred, and just as much sense to insist that all of it is secular"?

In conclusion, Alistair Heys's "The Anatomy of Bloom" offers a rich and detailed exploration of the underlying forces shaping Harold Bloom's literary theories. By carefully examining the interplay of Jewish, Protestant, and Gnostic ideas, Heys provides readers with a deeper understanding of the "anxiety of influence," the "canon," and Bloom's unique critical methodology. The book persuasively argues that Bloom's work, far from being purely aesthetic and detached from history as he sometimes claimed, is profoundly informed by his cultural background, religious concerns, and personal existential struggles, including the trauma of the Holocaust. It paints a portrait of Bloom as an avid scholar and prolific writer with an almost Protestant work ethic, engaged in an "agonistic" battle with tradition and precursors, seeking to impose his own highly individual vision upon the literary landscape. It's a journey into the layers of influence, anxiety, and the quest for literary and personal "election," offering many avenues for further thought and exploration into the fascinating mind of one of modern criticism's most distinctive voices.
