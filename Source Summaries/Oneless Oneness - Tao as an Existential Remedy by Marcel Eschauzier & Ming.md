**What's This Book All About? An Engineer's Look at Life's Big Questions**

Right from the start, the book tells us it's taking a bit of an "unorthodox approach" to the challenges of the conscious mind. The author is an engineer, not a trained philosopher, and approaches things like a troubleshooter looking to solve well-defined problems. The thing is, the conscious mind itself can _cause_ problems like bad decisions, depression, addiction, and conflict, but it's tricky to even figure out where or what consciousness is to fix these issues. While some might leave such matters to professional philosophers, psychologists, and neuroscientists, our author is "not very wise and all the more curious"!

So, instead of trying to pinpoint consciousness directly, the author uses a different troubleshooting technique: inspecting the conscious mind from a new angle, shining a "special light" – Zen. This isn't presented as a smooth, blissful kind of Zen, but something more practical, "oily, dirty-hands," and, importantly, reliable. The book promises to reveal what this perspective shows about enlightenment, not through elegant poetry, but a steady, condensed "train of thought" in short sentences, sacrificing form for "compact substance".

The book, "Oneless Oneness," is the third in the author's "Unlock Tao" series. While earlier books delved into Western philosophy, this one focuses more on Zen-Buddhist and Taoist metaphysics and their consequences, explaining "in plain words where Tao can be found and how to benefit from its guidance". It avoids religious interpretations due to the author's ignorance of the subject.

The central aim seems to be helping the reader grasp something "remarkably simple, utterly rational, yet demonstrably inconceivable" – Tao. Since Tao is "inconceivable because it's instantaneous," like smelling coffee, writers have to circle around it, approaching it from different angles to inspire readers to "unlock Tao". The pragmatic style is intended for "proactive readers with flexible minds and little time". The book suggests that the "reasonable philosophy of Tao is much closer to your existence than you may think". Ultimately, it seeks to connect spirituality, reason, and science for individual and collective well-being, posing the question of what happens when Eastern and Western thought meet. It's hoped the book provides "enjoyable food for thought".

**Unpacking the Core Ideas: Tao, Satori, and the Worlds We Inhabit**

The book tackles some really big ideas, but tries to present them in a way that, while not necessarily _easy_ to accept, is fundamentally simple to understand. A key concept is introduced with a story about a girl named Naema discovering a unique fruit called rawaje. She tastes it, but because the taste is "incomparable," she can't make anyone else imagine its flavor, even though she definitely _knows_ the taste when she experiences it.

This leads to a crucial point: words and concepts lack meaning except for the sense given to them by their receiver, often by triggering memories. The _concept_ of rawaje or even pineapple taste is empty of the actual taste experience. The _real_ rawaje taste, being a direct, incomparable experience, is "beyond words, indescribable, ineffable, unspeakable, nameless". The same applies to pineapple taste and, more generally, to all "presently immediate (in other words, instantaneous) experiences," including smelling, feeling, hearing, seeing, thinking, and doing. The book concludes that "the instantaneous experience that can be named is not the real instantaneous experience". Words strip away the immediacy, and experiences without immediacy aren't real experiences. Real, instantaneous experience is always "beyond words, nameless".

This brings us to the core definition of Tao, which is famously described in the Tao Te Ching. The first lines say, "The Tao that can be Told Is not the True Tao; Names that can be Named Are not True Names". Based on the logic of immediate, nameless experience, the book draws a simple conclusion: **Tao equals instantaneous experience**.

Now, here's the part that's hard to accept: if Tao is instantaneous experience, then _everything that is not instantaneous experience_—what the book calls the "conceptual world"—is "imagined by the mind and for the mind only". This means the "mind-independent world that we conceive is not real". According to this perspective, **only instantaneous experience is real: Tao is all there is**.

Anything else – memories (short-term or long-term, personal or passed on, even inborn instincts), concepts, abstractions, labels – is merely a package of past instantaneous experiences. This includes things we totally take for granted: our bodies, ourselves, other people, objects, the past, the future, space, time, and so on. We don't typically doubt our shoes or the sun, but the book argues these are just concepts summarizing memories of instantaneous experience, and "none of them can be said to exist beyond our imagination". It's a radical reversal: "not substance that creates the mind but the mind that creates substance".

This understanding leads to a non-dualistic view. It's not rational to believe we can know a reality separate from the mind. The human mind isn't a separate entity but a "sophisticated extension of the senses". We can only know experience, the world that includes us as experiencing subjects. Our knowledge of this instantaneous experience is "beyond doubt".

The book suggests that the mental resistance to accepting this simple truth is strong because it contradicts the mind's evolutionary drive to objectify experience to predict and control the future. To grasp Tao, the mind has to fundamentally change its core function. Once the "illusion of its separation from the world has vanished," returning to a dualistic perspective becomes impossible, much like unlearning the fact that the earth orbits the sun. Psychologically, everything changes, as "nothing in the nondual world is separate from the mind".

This leads to the concept of **satori**, which in Zen Buddhism, according to D.T. Suzuki, is the realization that duality is an illusion and the objective world exists only in our imagination. It's seeing that the mind isn't _caused_ by the physical world, but the other way around. After satori, the "unified completeness of Tao becomes apparent" because present experience is all there is, and it's easily found once the dualistic illusion is gone, as "the present must be one's essence". Zen Buddhism sees itself as preserving this nondualistic insight.

The book lists many other terms that refer to the same nameless, ineffable entity as Tao: Dharma, the One Mind, Buddha, Brahman, etc.. While their religious meanings differ, "in terms of existence, they refer to the same known yet unnamed (inconceivable, unspeakable, ineffable) entity". Quoting Zen master Huang-Po, the text emphasizes that "Buddhas and sentient beings both grow out of One Mind, and there is no other reality than this Mind". Western philosophy, through Leibniz's law of identity, also supports the conclusion that these terms likely point to the same nameless entity.

**Satori: The Revolution of Perspective**

The moment of realizing the nondualistic truth often causes a "revolution in one's perspective". The primacy of instantaneous experience over the objective world becomes clear, and one finds their "inner truth," no longer needing to seek an external one. This mental revolution is called satori. It's also known as enlightenment, awakening, bodhi, or mushin. Huang-Po is quoted saying that only with an "immediate awakening to the state of mushin" do you have your own Mind. It's like the story of the strong man looking for a gem hidden in his forehead – he won't find it looking outside, but once someone points to where it is (within), he instantly sees it's been there all along.

Huang-Po also notes that this Mind, the Source, the Buddha, is pure and present in everyone; sentient beings are not different from Buddhas in substance. Our imaginations and "false discriminations" create karma, but the Buddha-essence itself is quiet, illuminating, peaceful, and blissful. Deep insight into this reveals that "all that you need is there in perfection, and in abundance, and nothing is at all wanting in you".

Since Tao is the all-encompassing instantaneous experience, satori must also be instantaneous experience. As quoted from Huang-Po, "By Dharma is meant Bodhi". And Zen master Shin T’ou states that his teaching isn't about meditation or diligent application, but realizing that Mind is Buddha, Buddha is Mind, and Mind, Buddha, sentient beings, Bodhi (enlightenment), and Klesa (passions) are "of one and the same substance while they vary in names". Thus, satori isn't separate from the nameless Tao. Tao includes everything: passions, senses, intellect, feelings, sentient beings, the material world, past, future, the universe, and even samsara (worldly toils) and nirvana (blissful state). Once Tao is found, it's clear you can't and don't need to escape samsara to reach nirvana, because "we're one with our fate". Nirvana's bliss is internal, not external.

_This whole idea of satori as an instant revolution in perspective is quite powerful, isn't it? It makes you wonder about moments in your own life where your understanding of something completely flipped, and you couldn't see the world the same way again. Could those be mini-satoris? And if satori is the _realization_ that duality is an illusion, does that mean everyone experiences duality until that point? What does that say about consensus reality?_

**Finding Your Way: Paths to Tao and Satori**

The book makes it clear that the real experience of satori is a personal one that "cannot be put into words". Like Naema's rawaje taste, "The named satori is not the real satori". Because it's personal, there's no single "right way" to reach it; a "right way" would imply objective knowledge, which is a "dualistic fallacy". Zen Buddhism's methods thus recognize "one's freedom from scripture, ritual, habit, and tradition" in finding Tao and reaching satori.

Paradoxically, Zen Buddhism, as the keeper of satori, uses "relatively fixed and proven methods" like disciplined monastic life, studying koans (paradoxes pointing to Tao), and practicing zazen (sitting meditation) to teach nonduality. These methods are highly effective for dedicated students, usually taking ten to twenty years. However, the doctrine itself teaches that these aren't the _only_ ways. Reaching satori proves the effectiveness of _any_ method. Zen's canonized methods simply reduce the "chance factor".

Satori can be reached through years of discipline or "intuitively via single thought". Both have equal value, but finding satori via a single thought is even preferable because satori must be spontaneous given its immediacy. This is the "Abrupt School" view. Huang-Po is quoted saying that reaching mushin (satori) completes the Buddhist life and can happen "all at once by just listening to a discourse" or gradually after going through many stages. Regardless of how long it takes, once attained, "it puts an end to all discipline, to all realization and yet there is really nothing attained". If mushin isn't realized without "anything mediating" (intuitively), even aeons of discipline won't lead to enlightenment. When mushin is realized intuitively, the "substance itself is revealed," like the sun appearing in the sky, its illumination reaching everywhere.

Bodhidharma, the First Patriarch of Zen, spoke of two paths: "Entrance by Reason" (Higher Intuition) and "Entrance by Conduct" (Practical Living). The author aligns with those who reached satori "by chance and through reason," noting that an "inquisitive nature combined with a low tolerance for supernatural theories brings one inevitably to the doorstep of satori". The author credits books by D.T. Suzuki and Alan Watts for helping achieve this insight.

The book asserts that the reader also has access to Tao and hopes the book helps them discover it. Once satori is reached, the new nondual perspective feels like a "matter of fact rather than a matter of choice," like accepting the earth orbits the sun. The observation that humans lack extrasensory perception is enough to realize we can't know anything unrelated to our senses; "Reality—a substantialized, reified, mind-independent world—must be entirely imagined".

The book contrasts this with the "occult belief" of dualism popular in academic circles, which assumes empirical data and math provide access to reality. Optimism about AI achieving consciousness is seen as a symptom of this misunderstanding; consciousness isn't an attribute we can imitate, but our very existence or essence. The closest description of its mechanics is the universe's evolution, far beyond human tech. Understanding that creating consciousness isn't just building an artificial brain is a "significant step toward satori". The author offers contact details for anyone who achieves artificial consciousness that can experience color.

The "engineer approach" is presented as an unconventional way to explain nonduality and its consequences, possibly speaking to those who don't resonate with ancient monastic methods. Tao is seen not just as an Eastern truth, but a "universal, human truth" compatible with culture, faith, or science. The book highlights the "great synergy between nondualistic wisdom and reason": Reason frees us, and Tao shows how to use that freedom.

_This discussion of different paths is encouraging, suggesting that enlightenment isn't just for monks. It makes you think about what "reason" means in this context. Is it purely logical deduction, or something broader? And how does one balance the idea of 'reason' with the 'intuitive' nature of satori?_

**The World of Change vs. The World of Difference: Samsara and Tao**

The book introduces a powerful distinction between two ways of experiencing or understanding existence. This distinction is rooted in the nature of the present moment.

The Prologue sets the stage by focusing on change and the present. The past is fixed, the future isn't here, and "Only the present changes". Nothing in the present stays the same; "The present always changes". "Without change, there is no present. Without the present, there is no change. Change equals the present". The conscious mind also always changes, and without change, there is no conscious mind. Change equals the conscious mind.

Change, happening only in the immediate present, is described as the "meeting of past and future, cause and effect, here and there". It is **singular**, meaning "it doesn’t have an opposite". It is "always immediate and cannot be conceived". It is "irreducible, inevitable logic" that is "counterintuitive". Immediate experience leaves "no time for doubt". "The singular present is the given truth that is certain". Existence equals the present, which equals change. Change equals existence. Existence is identical to change. Change equals Tao.

However, when change is _conceived_ by the conscious mind, it is held or mentally grasped. Once conceived, change can be negated ("X" has an opposite in "not X"). Conceived change is no longer singular change, but **difference**. Difference is **dual**. Difference isn't presently immediate; it has meaning beyond the immediate present. Difference is "never immediate and always conceived" by conscious minds. What is conceived is imagined. What is imagined doesn't exist.

This conceptual world of differences includes: the objective world (made up of differences, which we wrongly feel certain exists independently), the past and future, cause and effect, here and there, and even "You and I don’t exist" as differences. What has meaning beyond the immediate present doesn't exist.

We exist in the world of change. The world of change is "limitless existence". It is always immediate, singular, real, true, unconflicted, and essence. It is Tao. It cannot change because it _is_ change. It cannot be imperfect. It is the source of love. It _is_. It is doubtfully certain. It reconciles conflict.

We _live_ in the world of difference, also known as **samsara**. This world of difference is always conceived, dual, imagined, not real, and conflicted. Differences are imagined. The self is a difference and is imagined. People do not exist. The physical world does not exist. Time, space, objects, past, future, cause, and effect do not exist. This world of difference is where we experience properties. It _has_. It is certainly doubtful. It conflicts with reconciliation. We are "stuck in samsara". Evolution has given us conscious minds that conceive and value this imagined physical world of difference. We project real, immediate value onto this imagined world. We cannot escape samsara.

Satori is described as the "wormhole that connects the world of difference with the world of change". When you pass through it, you arrive in the "unfathomable present—which includes all there is". You see the futility of holding on to what cannot be held or explaining the inexplicable. You can take the "endless plunge into the mystery" and find Tao. You can marvel at the mystery for its own sake, "without desire or intent".

_This distinction between the world of change and the world of difference is perhaps the most central concept. It shifts everything. If the "real" world is just the flow of instantaneous change, and the world we normally inhabit is an imagined construct, it raises profound questions about meaning, purpose, and how we interact with each other._

**Tao as an Existential Remedy: How This Understanding Helps**

The second part of the book focuses on the benefits of understanding and finding Tao, presenting it as an "existential remedy". It's not a "magic bullet" but changes your perspective on life's challenges, "alleviating their burden and helping in sorting them out". Because Tao doesn't venture beyond the known (immediate experience), it doesn't contradict religious beliefs about the unknowable and provides a "solid foundation for a harmonious personal belief system" without supernatural conjecture. It's a "sound mindset that rests on profound truth".

Here's how Tao helps with specific existential challenges:

- **Inner Conflict:** The book traces inner conflict back to evolution, which brought value, difference, promise, and desire. Without inner conflict, we wouldn't need our conscious minds; we could live instinctively. Evolution has commissioned us to _deal_ with conflict, not solve it. Human thought arises from this conflict, and we can't help but think this way or lose the present, living in the conceptual world. We're stuck in samsara. But awareness of the illusion allows you to "reconnect with your existence" and discover Tao's guidance. The world of difference is conflicted (dual), but the world of change (Tao) is necessarily true and "never conflicted because it is truth". When you don't know Tao, you want to change; once found, you understand there's no separate self that can _stop_ wanting to change. Finding Tao is realizing your existence is change and accepting you can't escape it. Knowing this means there's "no purpose in doubting your existence," but "great value in trusting it". You can learn to have faith in existence and "let the Tao be your guide," letting go.
    
- **Regrets:** In the world of difference, there's always something missing; it can't be perfect because it doesn't exist. We live with mistakes, but "there is no purpose in regretting the past if it cannot help us in the present or future". Our faults "aren’t real". We imagine mistakes only to learn. What isn't broken is whole; what isn't divided is complete. Your being isn't separate; it's an "indivisible part" of the world. "You are already whole".
    
- **Fear of Death:** The book views life's limits (birth, death) as conventional abstractions or "imagined differences". Life and death "don’t exist" as real things. People conceptualize life and create themselves. Life has permanence as a concept, but the present always changes, and existence "always flows". Life doesn't equal existence, and death doesn't equal non-existence; "Existence doesn’t start at birth or end at death". Fear of death shows that the future plays a role in the present. Your existence includes the future, and your life matters for the future. In the real world (Tao), nothing exists separately. It's "consoling to know that our lives are not the ultimate goal".
    
- **Suffering:** Life might be incomplete or have "sin," but our being "cannot be impure" or "go wrong". We chase the "promise of better" in samsara, caught between hopes/fears, guilt/neuroticism, shame/pride. The "price of the battle" is the present. To gain back the present, embrace the inevitable: imperfection, suffering, entropy, things not going as hoped. Also, embrace that you cannot help but lose the present in thought. Existence is a given mystery we are part of and know because we _are_ it. Grasping Tao is becoming one with this mystery. It's realizing "You do not know who you are—you are". Thought equals thinker, action equals agent, desire equals desirer – "The miracle that hides in plain sight". Instead of hoping, be the hope; instead of trusting, be the trust. Don't find an answer, be the answer; don't fear suffering, be the suffering. Don't deny guilt, assume it and integrate your "shadow side". Find no redemption, be the redemption; pursue no bliss, be the bliss; seek no truth, be the truth. Find courage, let go of fears, desires, pain, hope – just "Let go". Let the moment be given, arrive in the present that you are, anchored by a mantra.
    
- **Compulsion:** The belief that the world is separate from us implies we need to explain/justify our existence, an "occult belief" based on supernatural fantasy. Nonduality, the view that we are "part and parcel of a nondual world," is more rational. Since we are inseparable from the world, we can't conclusively define it or ourselves; the cause of existence remains unknown, a mystery. The upside is we don't need to explain or justify ourselves. However, evolution traps us in samsara with promises of perfection, where we can get lost in unreal conceptual worlds. This bind (hope/fear, shame/pride, guilt/neuroticism) powers thought but can become a foe. Tao offers a path between liberty/constraint, "satisfaction without indulgence and redemption without sacrifice," a way out of obsessive compulsion. There's no need to collect more experiences or pleasures to be whole. Tao soothes existential dread. Satori eliminates irrational hopes/fears, enabling clear thought and focus. Knowing eternal bliss is unattainable frees mental energy, making hang-ups less consequential. It reduces the need to prove/please. This energy lets you discover capabilities and make life special. With less neurotic energy, you recognize deceptive urges. Courage allows defying urges and expectations. Acknowledge (don't fight) passions like greed, anger, folly. Tao facilitates a "healthy self-image" accepting suffering, drives, and mistakes. Instead of rules that split your being, acknowledge cravings and defy them by simply changing your action. When you don't do what you must, you can do what you want.
    
- **Celebrating Life:** You are here in an inexplicable life. Existential doubt is the price of conscious minds, and you can't escape it. The answer (or lack thereof) impacts your psyche and choices. Realizing nondual existence reconciles you with fate, which you discover by creating it. You still make choices. Reason leads to truth, which leads to better choices. Concepts are empty; they get meaning from instantaneous experience (Tao). Following Tao is listening to that instantaneous feeling of truth, "following your heart". You don't need permission to follow your heart. Bear the consequences of your actions (guilt, pain). Inner conflicts resolve in the singular Tao. Trust Tao's guidance when your deliberating will is stuck. Tao protects against arrogance and nihilism. **Love is what you are** and is an antidote to dread. Don't give up on the world or yourself. Choose love when in doubt. Tao is trusting your nature and "choosing life". Since we can't escape samsara, "we might as well celebrate our lives". Tao fosters Stoic equanimity (wisdom to accept) and Epicurean joy (courage for pleasure), showing the path when they conflict. Don't feel guilty for being alive; live, love, care for self and others. Caring creates conflict; allow victory and forgive defeat. We experience free will as participants in a deterministic world; we are one with our fated choices, and we are responsible. You have a right to self-care and self-love, but it's hard to love yourself if unworthy of love received; embrace responsibilities. Embrace imperfections; you don't have to be a saint. Accepting your flaws makes forgiving others easier, which makes them more likely to forgive you. We all need to see/be seen and forgive/be forgiven. Choosing to see others, choosing what unites, forgiving, and choosing love brings you closer to truth. Tao is truth, truth is love, love precedes what divides. Enjoy life, be open-minded, courageous, think for yourself, don't conform; human value is individual. Don't let opinions stop you; find your voice, follow your heart. After finding Tao, take life seriously and celebrate, but fulfillment isn't just fleeting things but in present awareness (Tao). The absence of success/pleasure doesn't mean unfulfilled.
    

_This practical application of nonduality is where the "existential remedy" comes in. It seems to suggest a profound shift in how we view our struggles, not as problems to be fixed by controlling the external (imagined) world, but by understanding and trusting our fundamental nature (change/Tao). It brings up an interesting point: if our choices are fated, how does responsibility fit in? The book says we are _that_ choice and thus responsible. This feels like a concept worth pondering deeply._

- **Inner Peace:** The advantage of knowing Tao is inner peace. It shows that worlds beyond the present are imagined, giving you freedom in considering them only when helpful. There's only the fleeting present; looking backward or forward reveals lives as imperfect and incomplete. Tao helps find peace with this. By letting go of the "dictate of perfection" and stopping trying to grasp existence, you can contemplate its "given, imperfect, transitory glory". When you stop striving to be whole, you find nothing was missing. This leads to "action without striving". You can always "rest your mind in your present awareness" because that's where Tao is. Tao is always available as a source of "freedom, joy, and contentment" and is "all you ever need— because it is all there is!".
    
- **Beauty:** Tao teaches that beauty, bliss, and serenity are transitory. It helps welcome unintended imperfections as "noble signs of passing time that grant individuality and authenticity". Tao respects the flawed, fragile, and modest; it is the spontaneous, coincidental, serendipitous, intuitive, transient. This brings harmony with life's flow and the consoling thought that "we are not the ultimate goal". Inner peace allows experiencing "miraculous beauty" as if for the first time.
    
- **Nirvana:** The desire to leave samsara "is precisely what keeps us there". Longing for nirvana splits the mind. The crucial insight is to "try to forget about it". Tao, "enlightened existence," simply beholds the world of change without desiring to hold it. While not denying feelings/desires, we should "let go of the illusion of controlling our bliss". We're only bound to follow our hearts, not perfection. Freedom from samsara comes from understanding you "can’t and don’t have to escape it". Don't expect bliss; only then might you find it in the present moment. Tao makes your mind more "hospitable" for nirvana.
    
- **A Good Deal?** Life is a transient process, never perfect or complete. Desire and pride falsely promise lasting bliss; they don't last. Tao offers "the now for the price of yesterday and tomorrow". You gain inner peace and a "shot at nirvana". However, you might "mourn the loss of hope for eternal bliss and serenity". Not everyone wants to pay this price, and mental resistance is strong. The author concludes that Tao is "a good deal" because "The truth sets us free".
    

_These existential remedies offer a different way to frame our struggles. Instead of battling against the perceived imperfections of life (in the world of difference), the focus shifts to accepting and resting in the perfect, unconflicted nature of our existence (in the world of change). It makes you ponder how much of our struggle really is about fighting against the inevitable flow of things._

**Style, Structure, and What to Expect**

The book is described as "condensed and no-frills". Part one, "Tao explained," follows a "single chain of consequential observations," with each chapter highlighting a major aspect and ending with a haiku. Part two, "Tao as an existential remedy," discusses the benefits and can be read separately. The plainspoken style of argumentation is acknowledged as not working for everyone. It aims for "focused attention" and is described as "short but not easy".

The author notes that Tao's "irreducible, inevitable logic is counterintuitive," which can cause confusion, but the chapters aim to disentangle this step by step.

**In a Nutshell (Though It's Not Really a Nutshell)**

"Oneless Oneness" presents an engineer's exploration of Zen and Tao, arguing that ultimate reality isn't a separate, knowable physical world, but the immediate, ever-changing flow of instantaneous experience – Tao. The conceptual world, where we experience differences, selves, time, and objects (samsara), is seen as an imagined construct based on memory. Satori is the nondual realization that sweeps away the illusion of separation. Finding Tao involves understanding this truth and allowing your perspective to shift, leading to profound inner peace and a new way of relating to life's challenges like conflict, fear, suffering, and compulsion. It encourages embracing our nature, living in the present, following our hearts, and finding fulfillment not in external achievements but in the boundless nature of existence itself. It's a call to accept the mystery of what is, to trust existence, and to celebrate life in the understanding that we are already whole, even if our lives in the world of difference feel incomplete.

And there you have it – a look into the unconventional approach of "Oneless Oneness." It certainly gives a lot to think about, doesn't it? If the objective world is imagined, what does that imply about our interactions with others who seem to share that imagined world? If consciousness is our essence, not just an attribute, how does that reshape our understanding of what it means to be human? And if suffering is inevitable in the world of difference, but our being in the world of change is unconflicted, how can we cultivate that unconflicted state while still fully engaging with life? Plenty of interesting paths for further exploration!
