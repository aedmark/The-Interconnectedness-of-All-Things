Think of this book as your personal guide to building a strong spiritual foundation and making deep connections through prayer and meditation. It's not just about reading words; it's about using them to transform your mind and make your life incredibly meaningful. The author expresses a wish for everyone who reads his books to find deep inner peace and accomplish the real meaning of human life. This volume provides the very tools to help make that happen.

Let's take a look at some of the wonderful things you'll find inside this volume, presented in an easy-to-understand way.

### **The Heart of Daily Practice: Essential Prayers**

Volume III contains several key sets of prayers and sadhanas (ritual prayers) that are fundamental to modern Kadampa Buddhist practice. They are designed to help us prepare our minds, accumulate good fortune (merit), purify negativity, receive blessings, and develop powerful spiritual realizations.

**1. Liberating Prayer: Praise to Buddha Shakyamuni**

Imagine starting your day or practice by connecting with the very founder of Buddhism! This prayer, often recited at the beginning of teachings, meditations, and prayers in Kadampa Buddhist Centres, is a heartfelt praise to Buddha Shakyamuni. It hails him as a precious treasury of compassion and the bestower of supreme inner peace. He is described as loving all beings without exception, being the source of happiness and goodness, and guiding us to the liberating path.

The prayer beautifully describes Buddha's qualities: his body is like a wishfulfilling jewel, his speech is supreme, purifying nectar, and his mind is a refuge for all living beings. By turning to him with faith and folded hands, we request the light of his wisdom to dispel the darkness in our minds and heal our mental continuum. We also ask him to nourish us with his goodness so that we, in turn, can benefit others. Isn't it inspiring to think of connecting with such a powerful source of wisdom and compassion?

The prayer concludes with aspirations for suffering to quickly cease, happiness and joy to be fulfilled, and holy Dharma to flourish forever.

**Ideas to Explore:** How does connecting with an enlightened being like Buddha Shakyamuni help us on our spiritual path? What does it mean to "heal your mental continuum"? How can you integrate qualities like compassion and wisdom into your own life based on Buddha's example?

**2. Prayers for Meditation: Brief Preparatory Prayers**

Before we cultivate outer crops, we prepare the soil by removing obstacles, enriching it, and providing the right conditions. Similarly, to cultivate the "inner crops" of Dharma realizations, we need to prepare our minds. These prayers are the essence of that preparation.

- **Purifying Negative Karma:** If we don't purify the negative karma we've accumulated, it's said to obstruct the growth of our spiritual understanding. So, purification is a key first step.
- **Accumulating Merit:** We also need to give our mind strength to support the growth of realizations, and we do this by accumulating merit, or good fortune.
- **Receiving Blessings:** Finally, to activate and sustain the growth of Dharma realizations, we need to receive the blessings of the holy beings. This is why relying on a Spiritual Guide is so important – they are the representative through whom we receive these powerful blessings.

These brief prayers are designed to accomplish these three preparations:

- **Going for Refuge:** This is fundamental to entering Buddhism. We sincerely determine and promise to seek refuge in Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha (the Three Jewels) throughout our lives. Buddha is the source of our happiness, Dharma is the actual protection from suffering, and Sangha are the supreme spiritual friends who guide us. Reciting the refuge prayer daily with strong faith helps us maintain this promise and receive blessings and protection. Think of the Three Jewels as precious wishfulfilling jewels that can help us fulfill our wishes and the wishes of all beings.
- **Generating Bodhichitta:** This is the gateway to entering the path to enlightenment. It's the supreme good heart, the spontaneous wish to attain enlightenment for the direct benefit of each and every living being. It means recognizing that the happiness and freedom of countless others are far more important than our own. Reciting the prayer for generating bodhichitta ("Through the virtues I collect...") helps cultivate this mind.
- **Generating the Four Immeasurables:** This practice involves cultivating boundless attitudes of love, compassion, joy, and equanimity towards all sentient beings. It's a beautiful way to open our hearts to everyone, wishing them happiness, freedom from suffering, never to be separated from happiness, and to be free from hatred and attachment.
- **Visualizing the Field for Accumulating Merit:** This involves visualizing Buddha Shakyamuni surrounded by all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the space before us, like the full moon surrounded by stars. This creates a powerful visual focus for our prayers and offerings.
- **Prayer of Seven Limbs:** These seven practices are like the limbs supporting the main body of practice, making it effective. They include prostration (purifying negative karma, increasing merit, respecting holy beings), offerings (anything that delights enlightened beings, especially compassion), confession/purification (supreme method to prevent future suffering and remove obstacles), rejoicing (accumulating immeasurable good fortune by delighting in the virtues of others, especially Buddhas), requesting the turning of the Wheel of Dharma (asking holy beings to teach Dharma), beseeching the Spiritual Guides to remain (asking them to stay long in the world), and dedication (directing the merit of our virtuous actions towards enlightenment and the flourishing of Buddha's doctrine).
- **Offering the Mandala:** This involves offering a representation of the entire universe, our friends, enemies, strangers, bodies, and enjoyments to the holy beings. The offering is made without a sense of loss and is seen as a Buddha Land, requesting blessings to be released from the three poisons (attachment, hatred, confusion).
- **Prayer of the Stages of the Path (Lamrim):** This beautiful prayer summarizes the entire path to enlightenment, starting with strong reliance on the Spiritual Guide. It touches on key elements like moral discipline, bodhichitta, Bodhisattva vows, developing tranquil abiding and special insight, entering Vajrayana, maintaining vows, and practising the stages of Tantra. It also includes requests for obstacles to be pacified and favourable conditions to abound. This prayer is a condensation of all Buddha's teachings, suitable for everyone.
- **Receiving Blessings and Purifying:** After these preparatory prayers, a visualization is performed where streams of light and nectar flow down from the hearts of the holy beings, granting blessings and purifying us.

These preparatory prayers are practiced before engaging in actual contemplation and meditation sessions.

**Ideas to Explore:** How does the analogy of cultivating crops apply to spiritual practice? Why is purifying negativity considered essential? How does accumulating merit help us? In what ways can receiving blessings accelerate our spiritual growth? What is the difference between simply reciting these prayers and truly meditating on their meaning?

### **Delving into Tantric Practice: Heruka and Vajrayogini Sadhanas**

Volume III also provides the sadhanas for two key Highest Yoga Tantra practices: Heruka body mandala and Vajrayogini. These are considered quick paths to enlightenment, but require empowerment and guidance from a qualified Spiritual Guide.

**1. The Yoga of Buddha Heruka Sadhana**

This sadhana is a concise version of the extensive practice, suitable for those who have received the Heruka body mandala empowerment. It's a profound method to attain the enlightened state of Buddha Heruka. The practice depends on four "wheels" which are preliminary trainings: going for refuge, renunciation, bodhichitta, and Guru yoga.

- **Preliminaries:** As mentioned above, it begins with going for refuge and generating bodhichitta. Renunciation is the strong wish to liberate oneself permanently from suffering.
- **Guru Yoga:** This is a special training in relying upon the Spiritual Guide, who is seen as inseparable from Je Tsongkhapa, Buddha Shakyamuni, and Heruka (referred to as Guru Sumati Buddha Heruka). This practice is crucial for accumulating merit, purifying negativity, receiving blessings from all Buddhas, and generating the experience of great bliss and emptiness – essential for Mahamudra Tantra realization. The Guru yoga involves visualization, inviting wisdom beings, the seven limbs practice (as described earlier), mandala offering, making special requests, and generating the experience of great bliss and emptiness.
- **Actual Practice (Generation & Completion Stages):** The sadhana leads into the actual practice of generation stage (visualizing oneself as the Deity and their mandala) and completion stage (meditations on the inner channels, drops, and winds leading to the realization of clear light and the illusory body). This practice aims at purifying subtle mistaken appearance.
- **Mantra Recitation:** The sadhana includes mantras such as the OM SHRI VAJRA HERUKA mantra, the three-OM mantra of Vajrayogini, and the condensed mantra of the sixty-two Deities of Heruka body mandala. The mantras are requests for attainments and purification of obstacles like subtle mistaken appearance. The three-OM mantra, for example, invokes Vajrayogini and her retinue, requesting the attainments of the body, speech, and mind of all Buddhas and the pacification of subtle mistaken appearance.
- **Concluding Prayers:** The sadhana concludes with dedication and auspicious prayers.

**2. Condensed Six-session Yoga**

This is a very important practice for anyone who has received a Highest Yoga Tantra empowerment. It helps fulfill the commitment to practise six times a day, even if briefly. The practice involves recalling the nineteen commitments associated with the five Buddha families (which relate to refuge, moral discipline, generosity, reliance on Sutra/Tantra, relying on the Guru, making offerings, benefiting others, meditating on bliss and emptiness, generating as the Deity, and maintaining vows). A condensed verse incorporates all these commitments. Reciting this verse with strong determination helps maintain these vows purely.

**3. Blissful Journey: How to Engage in a Close Retreat of Heruka Body Mandala**

This section provides instructions for undertaking a close retreat of the Heruka body mandala practice, which involves collecting a specific number of mantra recitations. It outlines the structure of retreat sessions, including daily sadhana practice, torma offerings (offerings to deities and spirits), and tsog offerings (feast offerings). After collecting the required mantras, a fire puja is performed to complete the retreat. The section also describes how to perform the torma and tsog offerings within the retreat context. It mentions the purification of mistakes using the hundred-letter mantra of Heruka.

**Ideas to Explore:** Why is a close connection with a Spiritual Guide considered essential for Tantric practice? What does "subtle mistaken appearance" mean, and why is purifying it important for attaining enlightenment? How do practices like Guru yoga and Tantra help us cultivate qualities like great bliss and the realization of emptiness? How might daily commitments like the six-session yoga transform one's life?

**4. Quick Path to Great Bliss: Vajrayogini Self-Generation Sadhana**

This is a sadhana for the Highest Yoga Tantra practice of Vajrayogini, a female enlightened Deity who manifests the wisdom of all Buddhas and guides beings to the Pure Land of Keajra. This practice is described as ideally suited for the present day and offers a definite possibility of attaining full enlightenment. Similar to the Heruka sadhana, it requires empowerment and study.

The sadhana includes:

- **The Yoga of Immeasurables:** Incorporating going for refuge, generating bodhichitta and the four immeasurables, receiving blessings, prostration, and offerings.
- **Mandala Offering:** Offering the universe and oneself.
- **Requesting the Lineage Gurus:** Prayers to the lineage holders of these instructions.
- **Receiving the Four Empowerments:** Visualizing and receiving blessings that purify obstacles and plant the seeds for attaining the Buddha's four bodies.
- **Absorbing Gurus and Wisdom Beings:** Visualizing the Guru and wisdom beings merging with oneself, leading to a powerful experience of bliss and emptiness.
- **The Yoga of Verbal and Mental Recitation:** Reciting the Vajrayogini mantra (the three-OM mantra) and engaging in completion stage meditations to generate bliss and a non-conceptual mind focused on emptiness. This training in clear light of bliss is the main body of Vajrayogini practice.
- **Yoga of the Tormas:** Offering tormas to various guests, including mundane Dakinis and Dharma Protectors, requesting assistance and attainments.
- **Requesting Fulfillment of Wishes:** Asking Vajrayogini to lead oneself and others to the Pure Land and bestow attainments.
- **Requesting Forbearance:** Purifying any mistakes made using the hundred-letter mantra of Heruka.
- **Dedication and Tsog Offering:** Concluding with dedication prayers and the option to perform a tsog offering.

**Ideas to Explore:** How does visualizing oneself as a Deity in generation stage practice help purify our ordinary appearance? What is the connection between generating bliss and realizing emptiness in Highest Yoga Tantra? How does the concept of a Pure Land like Keajra fit into the path to enlightenment?

### **Connecting with Compassion: Avalokiteshvara Sadhana**

Volume III also includes a beautiful sadhana dedicated to Avalokiteshvara, the Buddha of Compassion. Avalokiteshvara is a manifestation of the compassion of all Buddhas and is usually depicted as white with four arms. The sadhana helps us connect deeply with this enlightened being and cultivate our own compassion.

The sadhana includes:

- **Going for Refuge and Generating Bodhichitta:** Setting the foundational motivation.
- **Visualizing Arya Avalokiteshvara:** A detailed visualization of Avalokiteshvara, including his appearance, symbolism (jewel, lotus, mala, antelope skin, Amitabha on crown), and compassionate gaze. His appearance signifies his qualities and path.
- **Prayer of Seven Limbs and Offering the Mandala:** Practices for purification, accumulation of merit, and making offerings.
- **Requests:** Heartfelt requests to Avalokiteshvara and his retinue to liberate oneself and all beings from samsara, generate bodhichitta, purify negativities, be led to the Pure Land of Bliss, and receive guidance on the path.
- **Mantra Recitation:** As a result of the requests and mantra recitation, the environment transforms into the Pure Land of Bliss, and the body, speech, and mind of beings transform into those of Avalokiteshvara. Sounds become the six-letter mantra (OM MANI PADME HUM, although the mantra is not explicitly written out in the excerpts, it is strongly implied as the "six-letter mantra" associated with Avalokiteshvara) and mental activity arises from wisdom.
- **Dedication:** Dedicating the merit towards attaining the state of Avalokiteshvara and ensuring that bodhichitta grows and flourishes.

**Ideas to Explore:** How does meditating on a Deity like Avalokiteshvara help us cultivate the quality they represent (compassion)? What is the significance of the symbols Avalokiteshvara holds and wears? How can the visualization of transforming the environment and beings into a Pure Land and Deities impact our view of reality?

### **Other Important Prayers**

Volume III also includes other significant prayers used in daily practice:

- **Prayers for the Virtuous Tradition:** These prayers are dedicated to the flourishing of the tradition of Je Tsongkhapa, seen as the King of the Dharma. They request that obstacles be pacified and favourable conditions abound for this tradition to spread and benefit beings.
- **The Nine-line Migtsema Prayer:** This prayer is a powerful request to Je Tsongkhapa, recognizing him as a synthesis of Buddha Shakyamuni, Vajradhara (source of attainments), Avalokiteshvara (compassion), Manjushri (wisdom), and Vajrapani (power). It's a request for blessings to ripen and liberate oneself and others and to bestow attainments.

**Ideas to Explore:** Why is dedicating prayers and merit important? What is the significance of lineage in these practices? How can devotion to the Spiritual Guide and lineage holders support our path?

### **Why Practice Matters**

Throughout the sources, there's a strong emphasis that reading alone isn't enough; we must put the teachings into practice. Just like reading medical instructions won't cure illness without taking the medicine, intellectual understanding of Buddhism without practice won't solve our problems. Practice is the method for controlling delusions, solving daily problems, and attaining liberation and enlightenment. Faith in Buddha is seen as the root of all spiritual realizations and leads to the strong wish and effort to practice.

Volume III provides the very prayers and sadhanas that constitute this practice, offering methods to purify the mind, accumulate merit, receive blessings, train in compassion and wisdom (including the profound wisdom realizing emptiness), and ultimately attain the highest goals of liberation and enlightenment.

This volume, with its collection of prayers and practices, is designed to be a constant companion on the spiritual journey, providing the structure and words to cultivate inner peace, solve problems, and work towards the ultimate happiness of enlightenment for oneself and all beings.
