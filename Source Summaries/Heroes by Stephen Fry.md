### What Makes a Hero, Anyway?

Before we meet some legendary figures, it's helpful to understand what the term "hero" means in this context. It seems that following the "Golden Age," humanity entered an "Age of Heroes". These aren't just ordinary people; they are men and women who really grab hold of their own lives and use human qualities like courage, cleverness, drive, speed, and strength to do absolutely astonishing things. They face down terrifying monsters and even play a part in founding great cultures and family lines that change the world.

While mortals traditionally felt the need to worship the gods and submit to them to survive, heroes are starting to lean on their own internal resources – things like fortitude and wit. They might get help from the gods sometimes, but somewhere deep down, they know they can stand up to even the divine powers. It's almost like humanity is hitting its teenage years, full of energy and a growing sense of self. These heroes are the ones who dare to make the world a safer place for humans to flourish.

It's also worth noting that the term 'hero' here isn't limited by gender. The stories celebrate astonishing deeds regardless of whether they are performed by men or women.

### Meeting Some Legends: A Peek at Their Tales

The book introduces us to several incredible heroes, each with their own unique challenges and triumphs. Let's meet a few!

#### Perseus: The Original Monster Slayer

Our journey into specific heroes often starts with Perseus. He's highlighted partly because there's a prophecy that someone descended from him will rise up.

- **Early Life:** Poor Perseus had a tricky start! His grandfather, Acrisius, was told by an oracle that his daughter Danaë's son would kill him. To try and avoid this, Acrisius basically locked Danaë away, but Zeus visited her as a shower of gold. When Perseus was born, Acrisius was terrified of killing him directly (the Furies, awful creatures from the underworld, would hunt him down for kin-killing), so he put Danaë and baby Perseus in a chest and set them adrift at sea.
- **Rescue and Growing Up:** Luckily, they were caught in a fisherman's nets by a kind man named Dictys on the island of Seriphos. Dictys became like an adopted father to Perseus. Perseus grew up to be a strong, skilled young man, excellent at fishing and sports, though his relative poverty compared to others sometimes bothered him.
- **The Dangerous Promise:** Seriphos had a king, Polydectes (Dictys's brother), who wanted Danaë but didn't want Perseus around. At a feast, Polydectes tricked the impulsive and perhaps slightly boastful Perseus into making a rash promise – to bring him the head of the Gorgon Medusa. This seemed like an impossible task, likely designed to get rid of him.
- **Divine Assistance:** Thankfully, Perseus wasn't alone. He was visited by Hermes and Athena. Hermes, handsome and unusually dressed with winged sandals and snakes on his staff, and Athena, grave and beautiful with shining grey eyes, were there to help. They couldn't do the deed _for_ him, but they could give him tools to "tilt the odds".
- **Heroic Gifts:** They gifted him Hermes' winged sandals for flying, a hood from Hades that made the wearer invisible, a curved sword called a harpe forged from adamantine (it could cut through anything), and Athena's shield, the AEGIS, with a surface polished to a mirror shine. The shield, Athena emphasized, was crucial for success.
- **Finding the Gorgons:** The goddesses couldn't tell him exactly where the Gorgons lived, but they directed him to seek out the Phorcides, also known as the Graeae or Grey Ones. These ancient sisters of the Gorgons shared only one eye and one tooth between them. Perseus, armed with his invisibility hood, tricked them by snatching their eye and tooth, forcing them to tell him the way.
- **Later Adventures:** Perseus's story continues with meeting Andromeda, who was about to be sacrificed. He saved her, using Medusa's head to turn those who opposed him (like Phineus, to whom Andromeda was promised) to stone.
- **Afterlife:** Eventually, Perseus and Andromeda, along with her parents Cassiopeia and Cepheus, were placed in the heavens as constellations, looking over their meteor children, the Perseids.

Doesn't it make you wonder how those early interactions with Dictys and his friends on Seriphos shaped Perseus? How much of his later bravery was innate, and how much was learned through a fisherman's life? And what about the sheer terror of being sent off in a chest as a baby?

#### Heracles: Strength, Trials, and Temper

Ah, Heracles! Perhaps the most famous hero, known for his incredible strength and his challenging Labours. He's also part of the line of Perseus.

- **Character:** Heracles was immensely strong, courageous, and passionate. However, he was also known for having a very short fuse and not always being the brightest. His real strength wasn't his wit or wisdom, but his _actual_ physical strength.
- **Hera's Hostility:** A significant theme in Heracles' life is the relentless hostility of Hera, Zeus's wife. She hounded him mercilessly, even influencing the prophecy about his future and setting up challenges for him. There was even a suggestion to change his name to "Hera's glory" to placate her, but that didn't seem to work.
- **The Labours:** Heracles ended up performing twelve immense tasks, known as his Labours. These were set for him by his cousin Eurystheus, King of Tiryns, to atone for a terrible crime (killing his first wife Megara and children in a fit of madness, often said to be sent by Hera). Eurystheus, often depicted as cowardly, was influenced by Hera to give Heracles impossible tasks, hoping he would fail and lose the chance at immortality promised by the oracle for completing them.
    - **The Nemean Lion:** The first task was to kill a lion whose hide was impenetrable. Heracles used his bare hands and immense strength, spending months training beforehand. He returned wearing the lion's skin as a cloak, establishing his iconic look.
    - **The Lernaean Hydra:** A multi-headed water serpent with poisonous breath, guarding a gate to the underworld. Hera also added a giant crab to the challenge. Heracles' nephew, Iolaus, helped by cauterizing the stumps as Heracles cut off the heads, preventing new ones from growing. Only the immortal head remained, which Heracles buried. He also dipped his arrows in the Hydra's deadly venom.
    - **The Ceryneian Hind:** This was sacred to Artemis. Heracles had to capture it alive, a task Eurystheus thought would lead to his death or eternal torment. Heracles managed to catch the incredibly fast hind and brought it back, arguing he fulfilled the task even though Eurystheus couldn't keep it.
    - **The Erymanthian Boar:** Capturing a giant boar alive. While the boar wasn't the biggest challenge, an incident during this labour proved significant. While staying with a centaur friend, Pholus, Heracles' short temper and the centaurs' reaction to shared wine led to a violent fight. Heracles used his poison arrows, killing many centaurs, including Pholus accidentally. One survivor, Nessus, would later get his revenge.
    - **The Augean Stables:** Cleaning King Augeas's stables, which housed thousands of cattle and hadn't been cleaned in years. This was meant to be impossible and prevent him from gaining immortality. The source doesn't detail how he did it, but Eurystheus later disqualified it because Heracles asked for payment from Augeas.
    - **The Stymphalian Birds:** Getting rid of man-eating birds with iron beaks and brass talons.
    - **The Cretan Bull:** Capturing the magnificent bull that Poseidon had sent to King Minos. Heracles caught it and brought it to Eurystheus. This is the same bull that later ended up in Marathon.
    - **The Mares of Diomedes:** Bringing the four man-eating horses of King Diomedes. Heracles famously fed Diomedes to his own horses. This labour included an episode where Heracles met King Admetus, who was mourning his wife Alcestis (who had died in his place).
    - **The Belt of Hippolyta:** Fetching the belt of Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons. While obtaining the belt initially seemed easy (Hippolyta was willing to give it to him), Hera intervened, spreading rumors that Heracles planned to kidnap Hippolyta. Heracles, in a rage fueled by his short temper and the red mist of misunderstanding, killed Hippolyta.
    - **The Cattle of Geryon:** Bringing back the herd of red cattle belonging to the three-headed giant Geryon, who lived on a far-western island. Heracles had to travel far, crossing the desert (where he threatened Helios, the sun god) and the sea (where he used Helios's cup as a boat and threatened Oceanus). He killed Geryon's guards (a two-headed dog and a giant herdsman) and then Geryon himself with a poison arrow.
- **The Final Two Labours:** After completing ten tasks, Heracles thought he was done. However, Eurystheus, influenced by Hera, disqualified the Hydra Labour (because Iolaus helped) and the Augean Stables (because Heracles asked for payment). This meant Heracles had two more to go, despite his outrage.
    - **The Golden Apples of the Hesperides:** Fetching golden apples from the garden guarded by a dragon and the Hesperides. Heracles learned from the sea-god Nereus that he'd need help and was eventually directed to Prometheus and then Atlas. Atlas, who held up the sky, was the only one who could get the apples. Heracles persuaded Atlas to fetch them by offering to hold up the sky in his place temporarily. This was a feat of immense strength.
    - **Cerberus:** Bringing Cerberus, the three-headed hound of Hades, up from the underworld. This was a terrifying task, but Heracles managed to convince Hades to let him take the dog, provided he subdued him without weapons. Heracles' argument that letting him take Cerberus would annoy Hera did the trick with Hades. Heracles successfully wrestled the dog into submission and carried him up. Eurystheus was so terrified of Cerberus he hid in a jar.
- **Death and Apotheosis:** Later in life, Heracles was given a shirt soaked in Nessus's blood by his wife Deianira, who believed it was a love charm. However, the centaur's blood was poisoned with the Hydra's venom, causing Heracles agonizing pain. Unable to bear the suffering, he built a funeral pyre and had a friend light it. After his death, Zeus brought his soul up to Olympus, where he was reborn and reconciled with Hera.

It's fascinating to consider the complex character of Heracles. He's capable of immense heroism but also tragic outbursts. The idea of fate versus free will comes up when he talks to Prometheus; Prometheus suggests he could walk away, but Heracles feels compelled by his tasks. What do you think? Was he merely an instrument of the gods and fate, or did he have a choice?

#### Bellerophon: A Hero Takes Flight

Bellerophon's story is closely tied to a magnificent creature: Pegasus, the winged horse. Interestingly, Pegasus was born from the severed neck of the Gorgon Medusa, just like the golden-sworded giant Chrysaor.

- **Dreaming of Flight:** Bellerophon desperately wanted to tame and ride Pegasus, seeing the horse in a dream and feeling a connection. He was advised by Polyidus to seek help from Athena at her temple.
- **Deception and Danger:** Bellerophon was sent on a dangerous mission to King Iobates in Lycia by Proetus, whose wife Stheneboea had falsely accused Bellerophon. Proetus's sealed letter to Iobates actually instructed Iobates to get rid of Bellerophon, without violating the laws of hospitality by doing it directly.
- **Facing the Chimera:** Iobates, after trying unsuccessfully to deter Bellerophon by emphasizing the danger, tasked him with killing the Chimera. This monster, with its immortal bloodlines and fire-breathing capabilities, was considered almost impossible to defeat.
- **The Fight:** Bellerophon, mounted on Pegasus, faced the Chimera. He used a lance with a lead tip. He swooped down, and when the Chimera breathed fire, the lead tip melted and suffocated the monster.
- **Aftermath:** Pegasus was burned during the fight but was healed by Chiron. Bellerophon, proud of his achievements, was warned by Chiron not to attribute his success solely to himself, hinting at the role of the Fates and gods.

Bellerophon's story highlights how heroes can be manipulated and face impossible-seeming tasks set by scheming mortals. His success, aided by Pegasus, is a triumph, but Chiron's warning reminds us that even heroic achievements can be influenced by forces beyond human control.

#### Jason and the Argonauts: A Quest for Glory

Jason's quest for the Golden Fleece is another epic tale of heroism and adventure.

- **Motivation:** Jason was tutored by the wise centaur Chiron. While perhaps not the brightest, he possessed courage, athleticism, intelligence, ambition, and a strong sense of self-belief. Since seeing Bellerophon and Pegasus as a boy, he dreamed of a heroic future and a quest that would bring him fame.
- **The Challenge:** His uncle Pelias had seized the throne of Iolcos from Jason's father. A prophecy warned Pelias of a man with one sandal. When Jason, arriving in Iolcos wearing only one sandal, presented himself and claimed his rightful place, Pelias suggested he retrieve the Golden Fleece from Colchis, assuming the quest would be suicidal. This quest was also influenced by Hera, who saw Jason as a way to remove Pelias and bring the Fleece (sacred to her) back to Greece.
- **Building the Argo:** Jason needed a ship capable of the long, dangerous voyage to Colchis. The shipwright Argus built the unique vessel, the Argo, with help from Athena. The Argo even had a special piece of wood from a sacred grove in its prow that could speak and prophesy.
- **Assembling the Argonauts:** Jason gathered a crew of heroes from all over Greece for this unprecedented adventure. These heroes, known as Argonauts, included famous figures like Nestor and less well-known ones.
- **Facing Obstacles:** The voyage was full of challenges. The prophetic prow warned them about "All the aitches" - Harpies, Hylas, and Heracles.
    - **The Harpies:** In Salmydessus, they met King Phineus, who was tormented by Harpies, foul flying creatures who stole and befouled his food. Phineus was a prophet blinded by Zeus but could tell them how to proceed if they helped him. Two Argonauts, Calais and Zetes, winged sons of Boreas, chased the Harpies away.
    - **The Clashing Rocks:** Phineus warned them about the Symplegades, or Clashing Rocks, which crushed any ship trying to pass through a narrow channel. He advised them to send a dove through first; if it made it, they should row hard. They followed his advice, and though the rocks clipped the dove's tail feathers and the stern of the Argo, they made it through.
- **Arrival in Colchis:** Upon reaching Colchis, Jason presented himself to King Aeëtes. Aeëtes, hearing Jason's claim to the Fleece based on his lineage, set him three seemingly impossible tests. Jason swore an oath to undertake them alone.
    - **The Tests:** Jason had to yoke fire-breathing bronze bulls (the Khalkotauroi) and plough a field with them. Then he had to sow the field with dragon's teeth (which would grow into armed men) and defeat them. The source doesn't detail the third task or how Jason succeeded, but divine intervention (Hera and Athena contemplating helping) is mentioned.

Jason's story is a classic quest narrative, emphasizing leadership, assembling a team, and overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles. It also highlights the influence of the gods and fate on human endeavors. How much of his success was due to his own qualities, how much to his crew, and how much to divine favor?

#### Other Notable Figures: Brief Glimpses

The excerpts also touch on other heroic figures:

- **Oedipus:** Portrayed as a sort of tragic detective. His story involves questioning his parentage, encountering his father Laius (whom he kills, fulfilling a prophecy), and his famous encounter with the Sphinx. He's seen as a more modern tragic hero compared to figures like Heracles or Theseus.
- **Theseus:** Presented as another great hero, particularly important to Athens. His story begins with a mysterious parentage – possibly the god Poseidon or King Aegeus. He's shown as a child inspired by his cousin Heracles.
    - **Choosing His Path:** Instead of sailing to Athens easily as a prince, he chose the more dangerous overland route to prove himself a hero. Along this path, he faced a series of brigands and monsters, often defeating them using wit as well as strength, sometimes turning their own methods against them. His "Labours" included defeating figures like Periphetes (the Club Man), Sinis (the Pine Bender), Sciron (the cliff-kicker), Cercyon (a great wrestler), and Procrustes (who made people fit his bed).
    - **Arrival in Athens:** After these deeds, he arrived in Athens as a recognized hero, welcomed by the citizens. He met his father, King Aegeus, and Aegeus's powerful wife, Medea. Medea, recognizing him as a threat to her own plans, tried to send him on a dangerous task, capturing the Marathonian Bull (the same one Heracles had captured earlier). Theseus succeeded, using his own clever methods.
    - **The Minotaur:** Theseus learned about the terrible tribute Athens had to pay to Crete: sending youths and maidens to be fed to the Minotaur in the Labyrinth. He volunteered to go as one of the tribute group, choosing the most capable companions, determined to end this.
    - **Help from Ariadne:** In Crete, King Minos's daughter Ariadne fell in love with Theseus. She gave him a crucial tool to navigate the Labyrinth: a ball of thread to find his way back out. She also promised to bribe the guard so he would be chosen first.
    - **Facing the Monster:** Theseus entered the Labyrinth, finding his way to the center. He encountered the Minotaur, Asterion, Minos's half-human, half-bull son. Despite the monster's fearsome appearance and the gruesome remains of past victims, Theseus talked to him, seeing him as a "monstrous mistake" and even feeling some pity. He killed the Minotaur quickly and mercifully.
    - **Escape and Legacy:** Theseus, using Ariadne's thread, led his companions out of the Labyrinth. The story mentions Daedalus, the architect of the Labyrinth, and his escape from Crete with his son Icarus (who flew too close to the sun). Theseus is seen as embodying Athenian qualities of logic, intelligence, and new ways of thinking, distinct from Heracles' sheer force.

Theseus provides a wonderful example of how heroism can involve cleverness and strategy as much as strength. His decision to take the difficult road instead of the easy path to Athens is a great illustration of choosing to _become_ a hero.

- **Atalanta:** Mentioned briefly as a female hero. She is linked to the Calydonian Hunt and is shown displaying surprising strength by lifting a boastful man named Plexippus.

### The Fabric of Myth: Variations and Interpretations

It's important to remember that Greek myths aren't like historical records. There are often different versions of the same story, and timelines can be inconsistent. For example, accounts differ on when Heracles killed Megara or whether Theseus married Hippolyta (whom Heracles supposedly killed). The sources used by scholars like Apollodorus, Hesiod, Homer, Apollonius Rhodius, Hyginus, Ovid, Pausanias, and Strabo all contribute to this rich tapestry of variations.

The book suggests that these myths aren't meant to be solved like puzzles or have single, simple meanings. They explore complex ideas like fate, necessity, cause, and blame, just as these concepts are complex in our own lives.

One fascinating aspect is the idea of "double determination". This is where poets and authors attribute actions or influences to both a person's internal will and an external force, like a god or fate. Was a clever idea just a clever idea, or did Athena whisper it? Did someone fall in love because of their own feelings, or was it Aphrodite's doing? Was Heracles' madness a seizure, or did Hera send it? The further you get from the founding of Olympus in the timeline, and the more central humans become, the harder it is to be sure. You could even tell many of Heracles' stories with almost no mention of the gods, suggesting that divine actions might sometimes be metaphorical ways of describing human qualities or events.

Thinking about these varying versions and the idea of double determination opens up a whole world of questions. What happens when two myths contradict each other? How does the possibility of divine influence change how we see a hero's choices and actions? Is there one "true" version of a myth, or are all the variations part of its meaning?

### Suggestions for Further Exploration

Reading about these heroes can lead to some wonderful explorations! You might want to:

- Compare and contrast the different heroic styles: How did Theseus's cleverness differ from Heracles' strength? What did Jason's leadership bring to his quest?
- Look into the roles of the gods: How did specific deities like Hera or Athena influence the heroes' lives, for good or ill?
- Consider the concept of fate: How much were these heroes truly masters of their own destinies, and how much were they bound by prophecy or divine will?
- Research the monsters and challenges: Dive deeper into the stories of the Nemean Lion, the Hydra, the Chimera, the Minotaur, and others. Where else do they appear in myth?
- Think about the human flaws: Even heroes like Heracles had temper issues or moments of vulnerability. How did these flaws shape their journeys?
- Explore the sources of myth: If you're curious about the variations, you could look up some of the writers mentioned, like Apollodorus or Ovid.

These stories offer endless avenues for thought and discovery, showing us the incredible, often messy, business of being a hero in a world full of gods, monsters, and destiny.
