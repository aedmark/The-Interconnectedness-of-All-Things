Involuntary mental sensations, those subtle yet powerful feelings that shape our experience of the mind. Drawing on the sources, we can see that these aren't quite the same as full-blown emotions, nor are they typically things we consciously choose or control.

Think of them as a kind of inner sensory system that monitors what's happening under the surface of your thought processes, much like cognitive feelings provide monitoring for subliminal brain activity. These aren't the results of deliberate rumination or rational conclusions, even though they might feel that way. They just spontaneously occur.

The sources offer several examples of these involuntary mental sensations, including a sense of knowing, feelings of certainty and conviction, vague hunches, gut feelings, and even that "aha!" moment of sudden realization. Beyond just feelings _about_ our thoughts, this system also includes sensations related to the very structure of our mental experience, such as the sense of self, the sense of choice, feelings of control over our thoughts and actions, feelings of justice and fairness, and how we determine causation. The sense of having thoughts that are uniquely "yours" might even fall into this category. It's suggested that the feeling of uniqueness often cited as distinctly human could, in fact, be a biologically prompted feeling.

A key idea presented is that the actual underlying mental calculations or the "nuts and bolts of cognition" happen silently, without any inherent feeling tone. Our _experience_ of these calculations, or the feeling that accompanies them as they enter consciousness, comes entirely through these separate, involuntary sensations. Without these sensations – feelings like knowing, certainty, agency, choice, effort, and causation – we wouldn't even have the experience of conscious thought as distinct from unconscious thoughts that simply "pop into our heads". These sensations act as the connecting link between conscious and unconscious mental activity.

Consider how you perceive the origin of a thought. When an idea "occurs to you" or "pops into your head," you tend to attribute it to the unconscious. Conversely, if you have a feeling of directly engaging with a thought, you're likely to conclude it's the result of conscious deliberation. The sources suggest that this distinction between conscious and unconscious thought is really just our experience of these involuntary mental sensations. This fundamental separation between the silent process of thought and the feelings about those thoughts is central to understanding what the mind is, as our knowledge of the mind comes through our subjective experience, which is profoundly shaped by the interaction of these sensations.

Because these sensations are involuntary, they have significant implications for our understanding of concepts like conscious control and even free will. We might feel like we are deliberately controlling our thoughts or making choices based on rational conclusions, but the sources suggest that the very feeling of doing so, the sense of agency or control, is itself an involuntary sensation. This can lead to a complex situation where involuntary sensations contribute to our interpretation of how much voluntary intention is involved in our thoughts or actions. The entire philosophical question of free will, according to one source, is triggered and shaped by these involuntary sensations and individual perceptions. Our personal views on the role of conscious thought are, in part, determined by our individual sense of mental agency and subjective feeling of control over our thoughts, which are, ironically, involuntary.

The nature and origin of these sensations have been subjects of philosophical inquiry for centuries. Descartes, for instance, explored ideas that are "foreign" and come from without, primarily through sensation, noting that they come independently of the will. He also discussed experiences arising from the intimate union of mind and body, such as appetites, emotions/passions (which don't consist of thought alone), and sensations like pain and pleasure. Descartes categorized passions as perceptions, sensations, or emotions of the soul "referred particularly to it," caused, maintained, and strengthened by the movement of "spirits". These bodily movements and spirit agitations in the brain and pineal gland were seen as causing specific feelings or sensations in the soul. For Descartes, the connection between bodily states and their mental effects was often a mystery, appealed to as an "institution of nature" or "teachings of nature" established by God to ensure an "appropriate" mental state arises from a bodily configuration. He suggested that ideas like pain, colors, and sounds might be innate because there is no similarity between the corporeal motions causing them and the resulting ideas the mind forms.

Later, Spinoza offered a different perspective, defining emotion (passion of the soul) as a confused idea by which the mind affirms concerning its body a greater or lesser "force for existence" than before, and whose presence determines the mind to think of one thing rather than another. He saw pleasure and pain, and emotions derived from them, as "passive states" we undergo when we have inadequate or confused ideas that involve the nature of our own body and an external body. Spinoza criticized Descartes' explanation of the mind-body union and the idea that the will could gain absolute dominion over the passions simply by firm decisions and habituation, finding it unclear how the mind could impart motion to the pineal gland or how their powers could be compared.

More modern views also highlight the embodied nature of these mental states. The sources suggest that thought is deeply connected to and even "is itself a body, embodied". Our bodies react in attenuated ways even to the mere conjunction of words representing reality, and this physical response is part of the mental interpretation. The connection between our thoughts and physiological changes has been noted by various thinkers.

While the calculations of thought may be silent, the sequence of accompanying mental sensations _is_ the experience of a thought. These involuntary feelings are fundamental to our subjective experience, making up a significant portion of what it means to have a mind and profoundly influencing our understanding of mind itself. Even the feelings we experience in dreams, such as fear or pain, can be generated by the brain internally, seemingly disconnected from the physical bodily processes usually thought necessary for conscious awareness, highlighting the complex relationship between these subjective feelings and their physical basis.

In essence, involuntary mental sensations are the non-deliberate feelings and subjective experiences that arise spontaneously alongside our thought processes. They act as a vital interface, turning silent cognitive operations into felt experiences, defining our sense of consciousness, self, agency, and providing the very raw material for our understanding of the mind. They are a rich area for further exploration, linking philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience in understanding the texture and experience of being a thinking, feeling being.
