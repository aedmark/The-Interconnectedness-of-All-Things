The division of labor is generally understood as the process by which complex tasks are broken down into simpler, specialized operations, often performed by different individuals or groups. Adam Smith is particularly associated with this concept, viewing it as the primary driver of increased productivity and wealth. However, the sources also present critiques and alternative perspectives on its effects, touching upon issues of social structure, worker alienation, and its application in various spheres of life.

Adam Smith meticulously details the effects of the division of labor, famously using the example of pin manufacturing. In this trade, a single worker unfamiliar with the process and machinery might struggle to make even one pin a day. However, when the process is divided into about eighteen distinct operations, with workmen specializing in specific tasks like drawing out wire, straightening it, cutting it, pointing it, or making heads, ten men could collectively produce upwards of forty-eight thousand pins in a day. This enormous increase in productivity means each person, performing only a tenth of the work, contributes to the production of about four thousand eight hundred pins daily, compared to the potentially single pin they might make alone. Smith attributes this significant increase in the quantity of work performed by the same number of people to three main circumstances: the increase of dexterity in each specialized workman, the saving of time commonly lost in switching between different tasks, and the invention of machines that facilitate and abridge labor. He suggests that the invention of many machines is originally owed to the division of labor itself, as directing a worker's whole attention towards one simple object makes them more likely to discover easier and quicker methods for their specific task.

The principle of the division of labor extends beyond manufacturing, influencing society as a whole, such that different trades and employments separate from one another. This separation is often more pronounced in countries with a high degree of industry and improvement; for example, in an improved society, a farmer is typically just a farmer, and a manufacturer is just a manufacturer. While agriculture also utilizes the division of labor, its seasonal nature and the interconnectedness of tasks (like ploughing, harrowing, and sowing often being done by the same person) limit the extent of specialization compared to manufactures. The great multiplication of productions resulting from the division of labor in a well-governed society leads to universal opulence, extending even to the lowest ranks, as every workman produces a surplus of their own work that they can exchange for the surplus produce of others, leading to a general plenty. Even the seemingly simple accommodation of a common laborer in a civilized country involves the joint labor of a multitude of people across various trades and industries, from shepherds and wool workers to merchants, carriers, ship-builders, and those who produce tools.

According to Smith, this division of labor is not initially a result of deliberate human foresight aimed at general opulence. Instead, it is a necessary, though slow and gradual, consequence of a natural human propensity to "truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another". This trucking disposition encourages individuals to specialize in occupations where they have a particular talent or genius, knowing they can exchange the surplus produce of their labor for things they need that are produced by others. The extent to which the division of labor can be carried out is, therefore, limited by the extent of the market or the power of exchanging. Once the division of labor is thoroughly established, individuals become dependent on exchange for most of their needs, essentially becoming merchants to some degree, and society transforms into a commercial one. The development of money becomes necessary because direct barter can be "clogged and embarrassed" when individuals wanting to exchange goods do not possess something the other party needs.

However, the sources also highlight significant downsides and critiques of the division of labor. Marxian analysis, influenced by Adam Smith's observations, focuses on the dehumanizing and negative consequences. For Marx, the division of labor, particularly the detailed subdivision of tasks within a productive process (distinguished from the social division of labor which existed before capitalism), leads to a rigid sphere of activity from which workers cannot escape, denying them the fulfillment of their creative powers. Adorno echoes this, explaining how capitalist production processes are broken into increasingly smaller tasks, leading to a lack of control for workers over the production process and the final product. Workers use only a small part of their capacities, making their work repetitive and monotonous, and they become increasingly unable to relate to the whole product. This process can mould workers, making them seem like parts of a machine, with negative effects on physical and emotional health and a reduction in the ability to interact with people or experience the world. The division of labor also brings into being a "slavelike state of affairs" where workers do not control the means of their own subsistence. Furthermore, it replaces human relations with relations of production, treating individuals as economic units, and alienates workers from each other as they compete for personal gain. Crucially, for Marx, the division of labor implies the division between capital and labor, leading to class divisions where owners of the means of production appropriate the greater part of what producers create. This results in a master-slave relationship between the class of owners and the class of producers, inevitably leading to class struggle. This critique resonates with the observation that the ruling class perspective historically considered the proletarian primarily as a worker needing only the minimum for maintaining labor power, ignoring their "leisure and humanity," a situation that only changed as commodity abundance required the worker's additional collaboration as a consumer.

Beyond economic production in the traditional sense, the concept of division of labor appears in other contexts in the sources. In a philosophical context, Descartes suggests dividing difficulties into as many parts as necessary for a solution, similar to breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable parts. In political philosophy, John Rawls describes a "division of labor between stages" in establishing social justice within the basic structure of society. The constitutional convention stage focuses on the first principle of justice (equal liberty and political justice), while the legislative stage addresses the second principle (social and economic policies aimed at maximizing the long-term expectations of the least advantaged under fair equality of opportunity). Rawls also describes the government's role in establishing background institutions as divided into four functional branches: the allocation branch (maintaining competitive markets and correcting inefficiencies), the stabilization branch (achieving full employment), the transfer branch (guaranteeing a social minimum based on needs), and presumably a fourth branch related to public goods, though only the first three are detailed in the provided text. This functional division is distinct from the usual organization of government. Even in a "well-ordered society," Rawls suggests a division of labor persists, not in a way that makes anyone servile or confined to monotonous tasks, but allowing individuals to pursue their good in their own ways while relying on others for things they cannot or do not do themselves. Human sociability implies dependence on others to attain excellences one lacks, making collective activity and social associations essential.

The division of labor is also discussed in terms of gender and domestic life. Aristotle, as presented in one source, sets forth a traditional view of the division of labor between men and women based on perceived natural differences in strength and capabilities, with men foraging abroad and being capable of movement, and women keeping house and being suited for sedentary tasks. They are seen as mutually supplying for one another, putting their advantages into a common stock. However, feminist perspectives challenge this traditional sex-based division of labor. One source notes that the phrase "division of labor between the sexes" often implies genetically determined roles (men hunt/fight, women gather/nurse/keep house), which confines women to the "private sphere". This sexual segregation has been seen as functional in maintaining the existing social structure. The traditional division assigning the home to women and the world to men has created a prejudice favoring home duties as "womanly" and other work as "manly". It is argued that breaking down housekeeping into specialized tasks could allow women to choose and train for specific roles, potentially working fewer hours in the home and freeing them for other, more suitable work, thus increasing society's productive power. The public attitude has made women's entry into gainful occupations slow, though machinery and division of labor have enabled unskilled women's labor in occupations formerly held by men. Division of labor has made women's occupations within industries less varied than men's, with similar tasks performed by women in different industries. The demand for "equal pay for equal work" has been a key issue for female laborers. Furthermore, the unequal division of household labor is a frequent source of conflict in relationships, and feeling that it is unfair can lead to dissatisfaction. Expressing gratitude for a partner's contributions, understanding different tolerance levels for disorder, and taking responsibility for specific tasks can help address imbalances and foster a greater sense of fairness and satisfaction. The notion that domestic work is not considered production or that it lacks full politico-productive status is critiqued from a feminist perspective.

Other instances of the division of labor mentioned include the historical separation of academic disciplines, like sociology from economics, reflecting increased specialization in intellectual labor. Hume is noted as potentially originating the idea, calling it "the partition of employments," with specialization being a synonym. International commerce is also described as a form of division of labor among nations, where each specializes based on resources, leading to mutual advantages and greater social wealth. In modern global supply chains, specialization allows for different parts of a product to be made in various countries, leveraging different workforce skills and costs. The caste system is explained as a form of division of labor, where groups like Vaisyas were responsible for creating and distributing material wealth through agriculture, cattle-rearing, and trade, a principle that could extend to modern professions like lawyers and doctors who exchange knowledge for compensation.

Despite the economic advantages emphasized by some, concerns about the potential negative impacts of the division of labor persist. These include the possibility of "mental mutilation," contraction of the mind, and extinction of "heroic spirit" due to individuals' thoughts being employed about only one particular thing. Smith himself noted this and suggested that government attention to education was necessary to counteract this "deformity". The potential for the objective structure of economic relationships (shaped by specialization and monetization) to become increasingly separate from the subjective experiences of individuals is also highlighted. Some theories even link the division of labor to the concept of "anti-production" in social systems, representing segmented, coded, and rigid structures that control material flows. Ultimately, the division of labor, while contributing significantly to productivity and societal wealth, presents complex challenges related to individual fulfillment, social equality, and the nature of human interaction and development.
