At its heart, Buddhism, as presented in the sources, is deeply concerned with the problem of human suffering and how to overcome it. The historical Buddha, while not being primarily focused on abstract metaphysical speculation, dedicated his teachings to addressing this practical problem of misery.

The centerpiece of his teachings is frequently cited as the Four Noble Truths. These aren't presented as doctrines to simply believe in, but rather as an analysis of the problem of suffering and a path towards its solution. While translations can vary, the general idea is:

1. Life contains suffering or is inherently sorrowful (duhkha). This includes things like birth, old age, sickness, not getting what you want, getting what you don't want, and even getting what you want because you'll eventually lose it as everything is in time.
2. Suffering is caused by craving, attachment, or passionate desire (taṇhā).
3. Suffering can cease by stopping this craving/attachment.
4. There is a path or way to stop suffering, often given as the Eightfold Path.

The Eightfold Path, the fourth of these truths, provides a course of disciplined conduct and practices. It's often condensed into three areas: wisdom (understanding the truths), ethical conduct (acting well), and concentration or meditation. More detailed breakdowns include specific disciplines like right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration, among others. Buddhist ethics are often framed in terms of expediency – actions should be consistent with the goal of liberation. Key ethical principles include abstaining from taking life, taking what is not given, exploiting passions, falsifying speech, and being intoxicated. This moral self-cultivation is considered fundamental.

Fundamental to understanding the Buddhist view of existence is the idea that everything, including ourselves, is in constant change. Nothing is permanent; there is only the appearance of permanence. This leads to the concept of "no-self" or anatman. The idea is that there is no permanent, unchanging soul or distinct, separate self. What we call the "self" can be understood as a collection of constantly changing components (form, sensations, perceptions, psychic dispositions, and consciousness). The illusion of a separate self contributes to suffering. While earlier Buddhist texts might reject both the idea of a self and no-self, seeing the no-self teaching as a therapeutic strategy, the negation of self is a key element. The understanding of "no-self" can differ between Buddhist schools.

Building on the impermanence and non-self doctrines, the concept of Dependent Origination or Conditional Existence is important. It suggests that nothing exists by itself; all things are conditional and arise based on other conditions. This interconnectedness is seen as a profound truth. The cycle of suffering is explained through a chain of causation starting with ignorance and leading to old age, death, sorrow, and despair. Despite the lack of a permanent self, the sources mention the idea of continuity from one life to the next through the law of karma, likened to a seed producing another tree.

The goal of Buddhist practice is to reach nirvana, which literally means "blowing out". It is the state where suffering and the illusion of a separate self cease, the ending of craving, and full oneness with the cosmos. Reaching nirvana is described as stepping off the "Wheel of Life" (samsāra).

Practice is highly emphasized in Buddhism, often more so than belief. The dharma, or teachings, is often seen as a system of training or medicine, with the Buddha as the physician. Practice is intended to transform all aspects of human awareness and behavior, cultivating positive qualities of mind.

Meditation (dhyana, chan, or zen) is a central practice, though its forms vary greatly. It is not simply thinking about something, but a more active engagement. Different types of meditation include concentration (calming the mind), mindfulness (observing the contents of experience without judgment, sometimes labeling thoughts), reflective insight (analyzing impermanence, no-self, suffering), and constructive or developmental meditation (cultivating positive qualities like compassion, patience, gratitude). Observing thoughts without identifying with them is a key aspect.

Buddhism is not a single monolithic entity but has diversified into numerous schools and styles over time. The primary division is between Theravada (sometimes called Hinayana or the "small vehicle") and Mahayana (the "great vehicle"). They differ significantly on the object or goal of nirvana and the understanding of the self. In Theravada, the goal is often individual liberation, seeking to become an Arhat, a "perfect being" who is not reborn. Mahayana, seeing the goal of individual salvation as potentially selfish, emphasizes the Bodhisattva ideal – someone who has achieved enlightenment but chooses to remain in the world to help others become awakened. This reflects a stronger emphasis on compassion in Mahayana.

Other schools and concepts exist, often as developments within Mahayana. Zen Buddhism, for instance, focuses on direct experience and transcendence of conceptual thought, sometimes using dialectic methods. Tantric Buddhism (Vajrayana) is described as a further development, emphasizing practice and skillful means to accelerate the path to Buddhahood, sometimes incorporating ritual and integrating seemingly profane aspects of life. The concept of Emptiness (sunyata) is central in Mahayana philosophy, seen as a profound wisdom and cure for delusion. Mahayana also includes the idea of Buddha nature, the innate potential for awakening within all beings.

Buddhism often teaches through dialogue, with teachers using "skillful means" (upaya) to guide students toward enlightenment. The teachings themselves are sometimes seen as pointers, not the ultimate truth to be grasped.

The nature of Buddhism itself is debated in the West – is it a religion, a philosophy, a way of life, or psychology? While often appearing religious with temples and rituals, its core is not centered around a creator God. It focuses on the dharma and helping humans overcome suffering through cultivating awakened ways of living. Some contemporary forms, like Secular Buddhism, emphasize the practices and psychological benefits while de-emphasizing traditional supernatural beliefs or rituals.

In essence, the Buddhist concepts outlined in these sources provide a framework for understanding suffering, its origins in attachment, and a path of ethical conduct, meditation, and wisdom aimed at achieving liberation (nirvana) through realizing the impermanent and selfless nature of reality.
