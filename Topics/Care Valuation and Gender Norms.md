The interplay between the value we place on care and the roles society assigns based on gender is a truly vital topic, shaping not just individual lives but the very fabric of our communities and political systems. When we delve into how "care" is understood, who is expected to provide it, and what recognition they receive, we uncover deep-seated gender norms that have profound implications for equality, autonomy, and even our collective well-being.

Let's explore this intricate relationship, examining how care has been devalued, how gender norms perpetuate this, and the compelling arguments for transforming these norms.

### The Deep-Seated Devaluation of Care

A striking aspect of many contemporary societies, particularly in North America, is the widespread contempt for virtually all forms of physical caretaking. This isn't just about unpaid domestic work; it extends to professional caregiving roles as well. The consequence is clear: those who provide care are often paid little, defined as "unsuccessful," and their crucial contributions are often overlooked.

This devaluation has several layers:

- **The Care/Policy Divide**: There's a significant disconnect between those who experience the demands and importance of care firsthand and those who hold top policymaking positions. Since policymakers are often men with limited caregiving experience, they remain "ignorant of a core dimension of human life," rendering them "unfit for the job" of creating policies that adequately support care.
- **Valorization of Independence**: The degradation of care is deeply connected to a societal valorization of independence, which often denies the basic interdependence of all human beings. When individuals engage in hands-on care, they are confronted with this inherent dependency, which can shatter the "illusion of independence".
- **The "Puzzle of Devaluation"**: It's a genuine puzzle why an activity as vital as providing quality care for loved ones is relegated to those society treats as the least valuable, skilled, or talented. This practice is so universal that its deeply problematic nature often disappears into mere convention.

Philosophers like Eva Kittay advocate for "doulia," a concept emphasizing the need for social support and care for those who provide care. This is crucial to ensure that caregivers are not disadvantaged and that their invaluable work is recognized as essential for human flourishing and societal survival.

### Gender Norms: Shaping Who Cares and How It's Valued

The most prominent factor in the devaluation of care is its pervasive gendering. Historically and currently, women have been, and largely still are, the primary providers of care across the globe, both paid and unpaid. This isn't just a matter of individual preference; it's deeply ingrained in social expectations and reinforced by powerful "zombie norms" of male breadwinners and female caregivers that persist despite evolving realities.

Key aspects of this gendered dynamic include:

- **The "Feminine" Voice of Care**: Carol Gilligan's influential work on "care ethics" highlighted a "different voice" in moral reasoning, one that focuses on connection, relationships, and responsiveness to particular needs, as opposed to the more abstract, principle-based "ethics of justice" often associated with men. While Gilligan clarified that this "different voice" is human and not exclusive to women, its historical association with women underscored the "gender binary and hierarchy" that privileges the masculine (reason) over the feminine (emotion, care, relationality).
- **Selflessness as a Feminine Ideal**: Society has long equated "goodness in women with selflessness". Women are often socialized to prioritize others' needs, suppressing their own voices, emotions, and desires. This can lead to a "compulsive and self-sacrificing doing for others," which, while seen as virtuous, can be "careless" with one's own well-being and a "major health cost on women".
- **Embodied and Affective Roles**: Women have historically been associated with "nature, body, and feeling," while men are linked to "culture, mind, and reason". This impacts how bodies are perceived in medicine, where the male body has traditionally been the norm, and female characteristics like breasts, the uterus, or extra fluids are sometimes described as "special extras" or aberrational, reinforcing androcentric bias. Tibetan medical texts, for instance, overtly acknowledge this androcentrism.
- **Masculinity and Work**: Men are often socialized to identify with paid work, success, and achievement, neglecting care responsibilities. This emphasis on "mastery" and career can lead to "stunted men" who are deprived of the joy and knowledge that comes from intimate caregiving and lack crucial skills like empathy and emotional intelligence. Men's self-esteem and attractiveness are often tied to their status, salary, and wealth, motivating them to work longer hours and sacrifice other parts of their lives.
- **The Public/Private Divide**: Historically, care and emotion have been relegated to the private, domestic sphere, associated with women, while rationalist morality and public affairs were the domain of men. This division not only excluded women from political involvement but also legitimized mistreatment within the home by placing it "off limits to questions of rights and justice".

### The Intersection of Care, Gender, Race, Class, and Other Hierarchies

The issue becomes even more complex when we recognize that care is organized not just by gender, but by intersecting hierarchies of "gender, race, class, ethnicity, and citizenship status".

- **Mutually Reinforcing Degradation**: In most high-income countries, care is often done by "lesser others" â€“ racialized women, immigrant women, or the poor. This creates a mutually reinforcing cycle where the low status of care is naturalized by the low status of those who provide it, and vice versa.
- **Global Care Chains**: The global care chain exemplifies this, where women from poorer countries often leave their own families to provide care in wealthier nations, perpetuating global inequalities and maintaining the link between low-status care and marginalized groups.
- **Confronting Vulnerability**: The degradation of care may also stem from a deep, hidden fear of human existential vulnerability. By ensuring that "others" do the care, those with power can avoid confronting their own dependence and the bodily vulnerability that care inevitably exposes.

### Challenging and Transforming Gendered Care Norms

Feminist scholarship, rooted in figures like Simone de Beauvoir, has consistently challenged the social construction of gender, arguing that femininity is imposed by society and that biological differences are not the foundation of sociological ones. This critical perspective underpins efforts to transform care valuation and gender norms.

A compelling framework for this transformation is the **Part-Time for All (PTfA)** proposal, which advocates for a radical restructuring of societal norms around work and care:

- **Universal Caregiving**: A core tenet of PTfA is that everyone "who is able" should contribute a significant amount of unpaid care, suggesting a norm of roughly 22 hours per week. This is meant to ensure that everyone gains the "knowledge and connection that care brings".
- **Restructuring Paid Work**: Simultaneously, paid work hours would be capped (e.g., maximum 30 hours per week) to create the time necessary for care.
- **Revaluing Care**: The ultimate goal is a "revolution in the structure of our society" where care is fully valued, recognized as essential to human life, and no longer relegated to the bottom of hierarchies. This would lead to better quality care, increased joy for caregivers, and informed policymaking.
- **Benefits for All**: PTfA aims to address family stress, inequality for caregivers, ignorant policymakers, and time scarcity. It posits that "equality cannot be achieved without a fair distribution of care, and care can neither be fairly distributed nor properly valued until the hierarchies that it relies on are dismantled".
- **Transforming Masculinity**: A critical aspect of this change is motivating men to reduce paid work and increase caregiving. This requires challenging existing notions of masculinity, praising "flourishing men" who are nurturing and emotionally intelligent, and dismantling the link between economic success and sexual attractiveness. As men engage in care, they learn vital skills like empathy and perspective-taking, changing their understanding of gender and humanity.
- **Tools for Norm Change**: Shifting these deeply ingrained norms requires multiple strategies:
    - **Public Policy**: Implementing policies like fatherhood-friendly parental leave, fostering part-time work opportunities, universal daycare, and gender quotas for leadership positions.
    - **Formal Education**: Challenging gender stereotypes in curricula and teaching caregiving skills.
    - **New Narratives**: Creating stories that depict workaholism as pathology rather than ambition and celebrating caregiving as a desirable and fulfilling aspect of life.
    - **Democratic Deliberation**: Encouraging widespread public discussion about existing harms and visions for better structures of work and care, making norms a subject of conscious reflection rather than unthinking adherence.

Such a transformation, while a "huge social experiment" and likely to face resistance due to its perceived "restriction" or "intrusion," is presented as less coercive than the existing gendered and racialized norms that already heavily influence choices. It promises to expand individual freedom by providing economic security and fostering relationships of mutual respect and interdependence, where autonomy is understood as being "made possible by constructive relationships," rather than a fantasy of isolated self-sufficiency.

Ultimately, revaluing care and transforming gender norms is about building societies that genuinely support human flourishing, where the critical work of maintaining life and relationships is recognized, shared, and celebrated by everyone.
