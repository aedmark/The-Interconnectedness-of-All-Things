It’s truly thought-provoking how some of the most profound philosophical insights emerge from concepts that initially seem counter-intuitive, like "embracing uselessness." This idea, far from suggesting idleness or apathy, invites us to reconsider our fundamental values, purposes, and even our understanding of existence itself. Let's delve into the rich tapestry of perspectives on this fascinating concept, drawing from the provided sources.

### The Wisdom of the Useless: Chuang Tzu's Revolutionary Insight

At the heart of embracing uselessness lies the ancient Taoist philosophy of Chuang Tzu. He famously turned the conventional wisdom of his time on its head, observing that while "All men know the use of the use of the useful, but nobody knows the use of the useless!". For Chuang Tzu, the world was often a tragicomedy where the pursuit of utility led to destruction. He saw "scheming politicians falling into pits they had dug for others" and "predatory states swallowing weaker states, only to be swallowed in their turn by stronger ones," demonstrating how "the much vaunted utility of the useful talents proved not only useless but self-destructive".

Chuang Tzu often illustrated this through parables, most notably the "useless tree." When a carpenter’s apprentice questions his master about a huge, gnarled tree that is deemed worthless for timber, the master scoffs at its lack of utility. However, in a dream, the tree reveals its profound wisdom: "I’ve been trying for a long time to be of no use, and now that I’m about to die, I think I’ve got it. This is of great use to me. If I had been of some use, would I ever have grown this large?". The tree explains that ornamental fruit trees are exploited and damaged precisely _because_ they are useful, unable to live out their natural years due to human demands. By being "useless," the tree is preserved, growing to an immense size, untouched and free.

This concept is further highlighted in a dialogue with Hui Tzu, who dismisses Chuang Tzu's teachings as "useless." Chuang Tzu responds by asking if a man could use the vast earth beneath his feet if all the unused portions were removed, leaving him standing in a void. Hui Tzu concedes it would be useless, leading Chuang Tzu to declare, "So indeed it is true that what is useless is clearly useful". This suggests that what appears useless or empty actually creates the very space, the possibility, for utility and existence to occur.

For Chuang Tzu, the "perfect man" embodies this uselessness. Such a person "achieves nothing, has no reputation," and is to all appearances "a fool." Their "boat is empty," flowing "like Tao, unseen," going about "like Life itself / With no name and no home". This aligns with the Taoist principle of _wu wei_, or "non-doing" – not inactivity, but action that flows spontaneously without egoic striving or attachment to outcome. It's about letting the "doing come out of being," recognizing that a "relaxed person is simply non-obsessive, and the energy starts accumulating within him".

### Emptiness and Liberation: Buddhist and Taoist Parallels

The idea of "emptiness" (_sunyata_) in Buddhism offers a powerful parallel to Chuang Tzu’s uselessness. As Alan Watts explains, _sunyata_ (or _ku_ in Japanese) means "emptiness," like the sky or air, which "contains all of us" and is "full of everything that is happening," yet "you cannot put a nail in the sky and pin it down". This isn't a negative void, but an openness that allows everything to be. Embracing this emptiness means letting go of the need for "gizmos" or methods to "catch hold of something".

When we truly explore nothingness, we become "full of energy," free to be "thoroughly creative". Watts notes that if we understand that the universe is a "transitory system—like a bubble, or smoke, or foam on water"—and we don’t try to grasp or preserve it, then "the world of forms is very beautiful—if you let it go". This aligns with the Buddhist idea of detachment, which isn't about avoiding life, but about being able to "get mixed up in life and fall in love and get involved with all sorts of things" precisely _because_ you understand their illusory, impermanent nature.

The "useless" here can be seen as that which is "totally and completely useless and that nobody can find," like the "real self". This resonates with the Mahamudra approach in Tibetan Buddhism, which warns against clinging to the "absence of reality or emptiness" as a view itself, as this would be a "very flawed wrong view". Instead, it's about realizing that "all phenomena lack a nature," and allowing wisdom to operate non-conceptually, without fixation. This "non-affirming negation" is not about negating things out of existence, but understanding their dependent origination and thus their lack of inherent, fixed nature, which then makes "everything possible".

This acceptance of impermanence and the "absurdity of choosing," or the belief that life can be "significantly improved by a constant selection of the 'good'," is a starting point for liberation. It’s a "despair of this kind" that transforms into a "sigh of relief, of liberation" – the "proper meaning of nirvana 'to blow out, to despirate'".

### The "Useless Passion" of Existentialism

Shifting to Western thought, Jean-Paul Sartre's famous assertion that "man is a useless passion" echoes a different kind of "uselessness," one rooted in radical freedom and the absence of inherent meaning. For existentialists like Sartre and Camus, the universe is "godless and meaningless" and "indifferent to the existence of individual human beings". This confronts us with the "truth of life and death, of my solitude and my bond with the world, of my freedom and my servitude, of the insignificance and the sovereign importance of each man and all men".

Camus, for instance, saw the "demand for meaning" as absurd, believing we must accept this meaninglessness and rebel against injustice rather than surrender to suicide. The cost of this confrontation is high, but "human meaning can be had in our silent universe" through narrative values that "redeem them in our own eyes".

Sartre's "useless passion" arises from the human drive to "realize the synthesis of the for-oneself and the in-oneself, to make himself God". This project is ultimately contradictory and futile, hence "useless". However, this "lack of being" is not imposed from without; we choose it, and it defines our very existence. The problem isn't that life is meaningless _a priori_, but that "Life is nothing until it is lived; but it is yours to make sense of, and the value of it is nothing else but the sense that you choose".

Serving others can provide a sense of "utility on a human scale," relieving the despair of the "uselessness of everything". Yet, Beauvoir also notes the illusion in claiming to be "useful for something". For existentialists, to pursue "the good" or a predetermined purpose can be a form of "bad faith" or an attempt to escape the anxiety of freedom. The "serious man," for instance, attributes absolute meaning to "useful," forgetting that "nothing is useful if it is not useful to man; nothing is useful to man if the latter is not in a position to define his own ends and values, if he is not free". This can lead to fanaticism and tyranny, sacrificing human beings to abstract idols like "the Highway, the Economy, the French Empire". The nihilist, in turn, is "disappointed seriousness which has turned back upon itself," trying to escape the anxiety of freedom by denying the world and themselves.

### Adorno's Critique of Utility and "Less Wrong" Living

Theodor Adorno's philosophy, often characterized by a "relentless pursuit of a (secular) _via negativa_," also engages with the critique of utility and "right life". He famously asserted that "there is no right life in our current social world", instead advocating for "living less wrongly". Adorno criticizes the way modern society instrumentalizes human beings, turning them into "objects or appendages of the machine". He believes we can identify "objective bads" such as those evidenced by Auschwitz ("delusional prejudice, oppression, genocide, and torture") without needing a positive conception of "the good".

Adorno’s "negative dialectics" is a "perpetual defiance of the actual," aiming to reveal the "untruth of the whole" and to show "the superfluity of what is". This approach challenges the idea that form imposes order on chaos; instead, "folly is truth in the form by which people are struck when, in the midst of untruth, they will not abandon truth". The "purposeful purposelessness of aesthetic semblance" can expose the dangers inherent in purely purposeful or instrumental ways of thinking.

His concept of "profanation" refers to a "praxis, or procedure, through which things are given a new, nonutilitarian use". This isn't a return to an old, "natural use," but a "return" to what "has never been" – uses that were previously prohibited or constrained by rigid functional inscriptions. He uses the example of "play" as a profanatory act, where "disused objects" can be given "new uses as if they were toys". This "playful creation of a real state of emergency" can "overthrow the form itself, opening the possibility for a free praxis".

Agamben challenges the idea of defining humanity by "work" or a fixed identity, suggesting instead a "being of pure potentiality, which no identity and no work could exhaust". This resonates with the Pauline concept of "as not" (_hōs mē_), which is "the formula concerning messianic life". It means to use existing conditions (like being married, weeping, or possessing) "as not" having them, thus nullifying factual positions while maintaining them, and transforming them into a "place of pure praxis, or simple ‘use’". This "new use of the self" involves the "denaturalization and desacralization of the self," leading to a "pure singularity" without fixed identity. This "whatever being" resists both the "Western onto-theological ceremony" of holding onto being as pure positivity and the "alternate, yet complicit, approach of contemporary nihilism, which seeks to hold onto the Nothing".

### Other Echoes of Uselessness

The concept of things being "useful, but not simply useful" or "much more than useful" also appears in discussions of art and creativity. The example of Aunt Pearle crocheting a "Spiderweb" coverlet with "useless, highly rhythmic variations" for the "pleasure of seeing its complex elegance" demonstrates how beauty and enjoyment can arise from going beyond strict utility. This touches upon Kant's aesthetic concept of "purposiveness without purpose," where something can appear designed or intentional without serving an explicit goal.

Moreover, the idea of things being "empty" to allow for function is reflected in the _Dao De Jing_, which states that "it is in the space where there is nothing that the usefulness of the cart lies" or "the usefulness of the room lies". This highlights the crucial role of absence and non-being in creating possibility.

The idea of "disregard is to win regard" or concealing how highly one thinks of a person can consolidate friendship, suggesting that a degree of "useless" disdain or reserve can paradoxically enhance value. This hints at the complexities of human relations where transparency or constant usefulness might be detrimental.

Even in the realm of knowledge, the value of "negative knowledge" – "knowing what is not so" – is emphasized, as it helps us identify "the uselessness of certain popular nostrums," even when effective remedies are unknown.

However, the "use of the useless" also presents a challenge to utilitarian societies, where masses of people can be rendered "superfluous" if we "continue to think of our world in utilitarian terms". This demonstrates the profound ethical and political implications of how we define and value "usefulness."

Embracing uselessness, therefore, is not a call to inaction or nihilism in the conventional sense. Instead, it’s an invitation to step back from relentless striving and attachment, to find freedom and creativity in spontaneity, to recognize the intrinsic value of things beyond their immediate utility, and to question the societal frameworks that often diminish human potential by imposing rigid, often self-destructive, definitions of purpose.

### Further Questions to Ponder:

- How does the persistent cultural emphasis on productivity and achievement clash with these philosophies of uselessness?
- Can societies truly embrace "uselessness" as a value, or is it destined to remain a counter-cultural or individual pursuit?
- What is the relationship between vulnerability and embracing uselessness? Does recognizing our fragility open us to a deeper understanding of what is truly valuable, beyond mere utility?
- In a world increasingly driven by technological advancement and data, how might the "invisible and incomprehensible" Tao or the "useless" self find expression and meaning?
