Virtue ethics, deeply rooted in the philosophy of the ancient Greek thinker Aristotle, has seen a significant revival in recent decades. Unlike other prominent moral theories that primarily ask, "How should I act?", virtue ethics shifts the focus to a more fundamental question: "How should I live?". It's less about the specific actions you perform and more about the kind of person you become.

**Core Concepts:**

- **Eudaimonia (Flourishing):** For Aristotle, the ultimate goal of human life, or the "good life," is _eudaemonia_, often translated as "happiness" but perhaps more accurately understood as "flourishing". This flourishing is achieved through "activity of the soul in accord with virtue".
- **Virtues as Character Traits:** To live well is to cultivate and express various virtues, such as bravery, temperance, wisdom, and generosity. These virtues are not innate but are developed through consistent practice until they become ingrained habits. Aristotle famously described virtues as a "mean between extremes"; for instance, bravery lies between the vices of rashness (excess) and cowardice (deficiency). This "golden mean" isn't a rigid midpoint but a properly situated balance that a virtuous person understands through rational judgment in specific situations. Virtues are also seen as complementary, with the cultivation of one helping to foster others.
- **Emphasis on Being:** Virtue ethics prioritizes a "way of being" over simply a "way of acting". While there are right and wrong actions, their moral status is more about expressing one's character than solely the consequences or intentions of those specific acts.
- **Modern Interpretations:** Contemporary virtue ethicists have adopted Aristotle's general framework, grounding human flourishing in natural conceptions of how human beings are, rather than a cosmically determined _telos_. This approach recognizes that there are better and worse ways to be human, and the better ways involve developing specific aspects of one's character.

**Strengths and Challenges:**

- **Guidance for Moral Decency:** Virtue ethics appears promising because it allows for degrees of virtue. You can be "more or less brave or magnanimous". This offers guidance for those who may not embody full virtue but aspire to be morally decent.
- **Concreteness vs. Vagueness:** Proponents argue that virtue ethics, by focusing on character traits, offers a more concrete and less abstract guide to moral living than rule-based systems. However, critics sometimes find it too vague when it comes to providing a "decision procedure" for specific moral dilemmas. For example, being told to "do whatever caring would suggest" isn't always helpful when faced with a complex choice. This criticism is often leveled against virtue ethics because its focus on character rather than action can make it seem less equipped to offer concrete advice for specific moral dilemmas, a concern it shares with care ethics.
- **Individualism vs. Relationships:** Aristotle's account might seem individualistic, focusing on the flourishing of the individual. This can be seen as contrasting with the relational focus of care ethics. However, even Aristotle recognized the need for models to learn from, suggesting a social aspect.
- **Complexity of Virtues:** A pluralistic view of virtue ethics emphasizes the complex and multifaceted nature of virtues, involving dispositions to respond to various "items in the field of a virtue" (people, objects, situations, inner states, actions) in an excellent way. These responses can take multiple forms, or "modes of moral acknowledgement," such as promoting value, honoring rules, producing, appreciating, loving, respecting, creating, and being receptive. The legitimacy of these modes and their underlying "bases of moral acknowledgement" (value, status, bonds) can accommodate insights from different moral theories, including Kantian respect for status and consequentialist promotion of value.
- **Ethical Impoverishment:** Alasdair MacIntyre argues that modern moral discourse suffers from "ethical impoverishment" due to the loss of natural teleology, and he advocates for a revival of Aristotelian virtue ethics to reconnect individuals and communities with a shared good.

### Objective Morality: The Search for Universal Truths

Objective morality refers to the idea that moral facts exist independently of individual beliefs, desires, or cultural conventions, much like facts about the physical world. These moral facts are presumed to have a certain objective status, meaning they are non-subjective and something about which we can genuinely agree or disagree, and get right or wrong.

**Key Aspects and Debates:**

- **The Nature of Moral Truth:** The notion of objective morality suggests that there are universal moral requirements or principles that apply to all. It implies that concepts like "good" or "evil" are not merely matters of personal preference or cultural consensus but have an inherent truth or validity.
- **Hume vs. Reason:** David Hume famously argued that morality is determined by "sentiment" or "taste," not by reason. He suggested that moral judgments are "perceptual" and originate in feelings, not in logical deduction. This "is-ought gap" implies that one cannot derive moral "oughts" from factual "is" statements through pure reason alone.
- **Kant and Pure Practical Reason:** Immanuel Kant stands as a prominent figure advocating for objective, reason-based morality.
    - **A Priori Principles:** Kant sought a "pure moral philosophy" grounded entirely _a priori_ in concepts of pure reason, free from empirical conditions.
    - **Categorical Imperative:** His central moral principle, the Categorical Imperative, demands that we "act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law". Moral requirements, for Kant, are categorical, meaning they are absolute and unconditional.
    - **Treating Humanity as an End:** A key formulation of the Categorical Imperative is to "treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never as a means only". This emphasizes the inherent dignity and worth of persons.
    - **Duties of Right and Virtue:** Kant distinguished between "duties of right," which are externally enforceable (e.g., legal duties), and "duties of virtue," which involve internal lawgiving and strength of commitment to the moral law. His _Metaphysics of Morals_ developed a robust "doctrine of virtue" focused on character and obligatory ends.
    - **Deontological Teleology:** A significant insight into Kant's later work reveals that his moral theory, while fundamentally deontological (duty-based), is also deeply teleological (end-based) in a reciprocal relationship. The "objective telos" or guiding end of virtuous self-governance is "respect for persons". This means that virtuous actions are not just about following rules, but about freely setting and pursuing "obligatory ends" (ends that are also duties) that are determined by reason, not inclination, and uphold the value of persons.
- **Contractualism and Justice:** John Rawls's theory of justice, "justice as fairness," aims to establish principles for a "perfectly just society". It assumes that individuals, under normal circumstances, develop a sense of justice and can support their judgments with reasons. Contractualism, generally, seeks to identify the foundations of morality through "deliberatively rational agreements regarding the terms upon which we are to be permitted, forbidden, and required to conduct ourselves towards others". A deliberative contractualist approach can affirm morality's objectivity by suggesting that rational contractors would agree to a common code, thereby ruling out arbitrary or multiple moral codes for the same generation.
- **Ethics vs. Morality:** Some philosophers, like Foucault and Habermas, draw a distinction between "ethics" and "morality." Foucault uses "moral" for prescriptive codes and sanctions, while "ethical" refers to the aspiration to become a certain kind of person or lead a certain life. Habermas prioritizes "morality" (questions of right and justice, universal norms) over "ethics" (conceptions of the good, self-realization, relative values), although his moral norms ultimately rely on an ethical vision.

**Challenges to Objective Morality:**

- **Vagueness and Application:** While objective morality provides foundational principles, applying them to complex real-world situations can be challenging. For example, Rawls's "strict compliance theory" focuses on a perfectly just society, acknowledging that "partial compliance theory" (dealing with injustice) is the more "pressing and urgent" matter in everyday life.
- **"Queer" Entities:** Critics like J.L. Mackie have argued that if objective values existed, they would have to be "entities or qualities or relations of a very strange sort, utterly different from anything else in the universe," and our awareness of them would require a "special faculty of moral perception or intuition".
- **Demandingness and Self-Love:** The demands of objective morality can be perceived as excessively stringent or transcendent, failing to account for personal satisfaction or "self-love". However, a virtue-ethical conception of objectivity seeks to balance the "demands of the world" with the "demands of the self," arguing that objectivity itself is a virtue that expresses self-love.

### The Interplay: Can Virtue Ethics and Objective Morality Coexist?

The sources reveal a nuanced relationship, particularly within Kantian philosophy:

- **Reconciling Deontology and Teleology in Kant:** Historically, Kantian deontology and teleological (virtue) ethics were often seen as opposing forces. However, modern interpretations, particularly of Kant's _Metaphysics of Morals_, highlight his integration of these elements. Kant's "Deontological Teleology" asserts that practical reason is both principle-based and end-based. The ultimate objective end of reason, respect for persons, guides the setting of "obligatory ends" that constitute virtue. This framework allows for a "dutiful pursuit of virtue and happiness," suggesting that a moral theory grounded in autonomously legislated principles of duty can indeed be compatible with eudaemonistic ideas of flourishing.
- **Virtues and Moral Principles:** While virtue ethics focuses on character, it doesn't necessarily reject principles. In fact, many moral theories, including Kantianism and utilitarianism, can incorporate a theory of virtue. For a virtue ethicist, acting from virtue involves expressing "fine inner states" like good motivation and practical wisdom.
- **Empathy and Reason:** The debate between empathy (often linked to care ethics and sentiment) and reason (linked to Kantian principles) is a long-standing one. While Kant considered feelings "pathological" if they countered practical reason, others argue that empathy can act as an "information-gatherer," enriching our understanding of situations, even if not the sole foundation for morality. Phenomenological ethics, for instance, seeks to understand the articulation of affects and passions without reducing morality to mere feelings, recognizing both affectivity and understanding.
- **Partiality and Impartiality:** Objective morality often emphasizes impartiality, treating all persons equally. Virtue ethics, while recognizing this, also acknowledges the importance of "partialistic virtues" like friendship and parental love. A comprehensive view needs to integrate both, ensuring that broad-based benevolence is constrained by partialistic responsibilities, and narrow-based virtues are enhanced by universal love and respect.

The complexity of ethics suggests that neither virtue ethics nor objective morality alone provides a complete picture, but that their insights can be interwoven to create a more robust understanding of moral life.

**Further Questions to Ponder:**

- How can the "indeterminacy problem" of virtue ethics, which acknowledges that virtues can sometimes "point in different directions," be effectively addressed in contexts requiring clear, actionable moral guidance?
- Considering Kant's Deontological Teleology, what are the practical methods for an individual to consciously determine and pursue "obligatory ends" that align with the objective telos of respecting persons, especially when personal inclinations might conflict?
- If morality is intrinsically linked to self-love in some virtue ethics accounts, how do these theories safeguard against interpretations that might justify harmful or purely egoistic behavior under the guise of "self-love"?
- Given the historical shift from sentiment-based morality to rationalist approaches, what role should emotion and empathy play in a modern, objective moral framework that seeks universal applicability?
- How might the "pluralistic view of virtue status" (Swanton), which includes teleological and non-teleological elements, offer a more adaptable and comprehensive foundation for objective moral judgments in diverse global contexts?
