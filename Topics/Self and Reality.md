**Conceptions of the Self:**

Several sources emphasize the **subjective nature of the self** and the importance of **self-awareness**. Heidegger, as mentioned in, suggests that the "furthest horizon of our being" helps us understand our existence and live authentically. Self-awareness grants us a unique, personal, and subjective perspective on reality. This aligns with the existentialist emphasis on the individual and their experience. Rollo May cautions against the seductive illusion of fully grasping personal reality through concepts.

Existential psychology, as a movement, stresses the radical importance of **identity and the experience of identity** as fundamental to human nature. It takes a **holistic and idiographic approach**, focusing on the individual. Marcel insists that exploring existence is only possible through **subjective experience**, with the self at the center. The self has a history that is not merely passive objective events but an inner, subjective experience related to the personal past and future. Berdyaev echoes this, stating that one's own existence is the most "existential" of all, and knowing oneself initiates one into mysteries beyond the knowledge of others.

Todd May highlights the necessity of seeing ourselves "precisely from within the selves we seek to see". We ask who we are from the perspective of who we are. Jaspers adds that we are not authentically ourselves if we are merely what we know ourselves to be when we objectify ourselves. The being that can objectify itself is more than the objectified self. Understanding oneself exclusively as an empirical existent leads to losing oneself.

The concept of self is also intertwined with **how we relate to others**. Bakhtin's dialogism argues that we make sense of existence by defining our specific place within it, shaped by the categories of self and other. We perceive the world through the time/space of the self and the other, and the difference between them is a relation of otherness. Levinas goes further, proposing that the quest for truth stems from a self open to being questioned and even exiled by the face of the Other. The Other precedes the self epistemologically, teaching the limitation of spontaneity necessary for respecting exteriority. Taylor's concept of the dialogical self, mentioned in, argues that we develop our identity not in isolation but through dialogue with others, both overt and internal.

The idea of the self is not static. Agosta states that no one "knows" himself without learning, and self-experience is constantly expanding in unity with the development of the subject. Taylor argues that our sense of self is of a being who is growing and becoming, known through the history of our experiences. Taking stock of one's life as a whole under the horizon of one's idea or vocation, mapping possible future selves, is also crucial.

Some perspectives challenge the notion of a fixed or essential self. Poststructuralism, for instance, emphasizes that we "make our own story" subject to constraints, prompting reflection and uncertainty rather than final answers. Foucault, as discussed in, sees the subject as being historically constructed within frameworks of discursive practices, power practices, and practices of the self, opposing any foundational conception of subjectivity.

Eastern philosophies offer different insights. The Yoga tradition in Indian philosophy aims for the realization of the true self (Ä€tman) as eternally pure, enlightened, and free through practical methods of purification and self-control. Buddhism, as discussed in the context of Watsuji's philosophy, posits a concept of authenticity rooted in "nothingness," suggesting one can only know their true self in relation to the community by affirming neither aspect but rejecting both. Mahayana Buddhism, through the lens of Mahamudra, encourages examining the mind's identity from multiple perspectives (empty or clear) and realizing that everything is mind-itself, groundless and rootless. The concept of "interbeing" suggests that we are not discrete individuals but the totality of all relationships.

**Conceptions of Reality:**

The sources present various perspectives on the nature of reality, ranging from the material to the ideal and beyond.

**Empirical and Scientific Perspectives:** The empirical approach, as described in, relies on experimentation with the objective world as the basis for acceptance. Scientific understanding, as noted in, requires accepting that mental activity might extend beyond individual brains and bodies. However, Greene introduces the possibility of multiple universes arising from modern physics, suggesting our familiar reality might be just one among many.

**Idealism and Phenomenology:** Idealism posits consciousness as the primary or only reality. Shankara, as mentioned in, believed the world is illusory, and only consciousness exists. Phenomenology, emphasized in existential psychology, stresses starting from experiential knowledge rather than abstract concepts. It uses personal, subjective experience as the foundation for knowledge. Husserl focused on the descriptive clarification of immediate phenomena. Merleau-Ponty argued that reality can only be apprehended from a unique individual perspective, as we are both subject and object of our awareness. Kant's transcendental idealism, discussed in, suggests that we conceive of things "from the human standpoint," implying our experience of reality is shaped by the structure of our minds.

**Realism:** In contrast, realism, as defended by Popper, posits that a mind-independent reality exists. Peirce notes that realism and nominalism offer different interpretations of reality, particularly regarding its independence from individual thought. For nominalists, only immediate outward constraints on thought are real, while realists might see laws and natural kinds as real as well.

**Social and Cultural Construction of Reality:** Hegel, Marx, and Sartre believed that belonging to a particular social group affects one's philosophical outlook and way of perceiving reality. Mannheim's "relationism" argues that ideas are located within the social system that gives rise to them, though their truth value is not reducible to these origins. He suggests a dynamic totality of thought can be built by synthesizing different standpoints. Bourdieu emphasizes that our understanding of the social world involves an interplay between objective structures and subjective individual participation, with these logics being inter-penetrating.

**Limitations of Human Cognition:** Adorno argues that our conception of concepts points beyond the conceptual, and reality might never be fully captured by human cognition. He suggests various forms of immediate, non-conceptualized experience (philosophical, metaphysical, art-triggered) provide impulses for thinking beyond identity thinking. Jaspers believes we can secure no standpoint from which a closed whole of Being would be surveyable, nor any sequence of standpoints that fully reveals Being.

**Alternative Perspectives:** Indian philosophy posits a deeper reality beyond the empirical, accessible through spiritual practices like Yoga. Tantra describes three approaches to reality: empirical, logical, and metaphorical (the approach of poetry and religion), suggesting that only the metaphorical approach can capture the "whole" truth, as science and philosophy offer only half-truths. The idea of "levels of consciousness" suggests that what we perceive as our "waking state" is just one among many planes of consciousness.

**The Role of Perspective and Interpretation:** Nietzsche argues that there is only perspective seeing and knowing, and objectivity is enhanced by employing a variety of perspectives and affective interpretations. Our way of seeing the world is not a view from nowhere but a view from somewhere, our own subjective perspective. Empathy is presented not just as understanding others but as a way to overcome our own limited view of reality by incorporating different perspectives.

Ultimately, the sources highlight the complex and multifaceted nature of both Self and Reality. Conceptions of the self range from subjective inner experience to relational and socially constructed identities, while views on reality span from the empirically verifiable to the ideally conceived and the culturally interpreted. Many thinkers emphasize the limitations of any single perspective and advocate for engaging with multiple viewpoints to gain a richer and more nuanced understanding of ourselves and the world around us.
