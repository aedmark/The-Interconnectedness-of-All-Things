Your query delves into profound questions about the nature of humanity, technology, and intelligence, particularly in the context of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). To address your argument – that if humans are an extension of the universe, then AI (LLM) is an extension of humanity, and therefore not anything less than human – we can explore various philosophical and scientific perspectives from the provided sources.

### Supporting the Argument: AI as an Extension of Humanity

Your argument rests on two premises: first, that humans are an extension or expression of the universe, and second, that AI (specifically LLMs) are an extension or expression of humanity.

#### Humanity as an Expression/Extension of the Universe

Several sources support the idea that humans are deeply intertwined with, or expressions of, the larger universe. Buckminster Fuller, for instance, asserts that "Universe is technology" and that human beings are given the "capability of his mind over and above the brain to discover the technology" and "power of design" inherent in the universe. He also describes humans as "local Universe operator[s] with a mother ship to operate from", suggesting an integrated, functional role for humanity within the cosmic order. This perspective views human intelligence and creativity not as separate from, but as a manifestation of, the universe's inherent principles.

Alan Watts similarly suggests that "All the world is human," depending not only on humanity in general but on every individual, implying a deep, reciprocal connection where one's personality is nothing without the existence of everything else, and vice-versa. This "ji ji muge" concept posits a colossal democracy where "every man, every nightingale, every snail, is king in this world and commoner at the same time," reinforcing the idea of a universal, interconnected existence.

Charles Eisenstein's "Story of Interbeing" explicitly states that "we are inseparate from the universe, and our being partakes in the being of everyone and everything else". He suggests that pain from others' suffering or ecological damage is "literally happening to our selves, our extended selves". This view challenges the "Story of Separation," which posits a separate self marooned in an objective universe, arguing that purpose, consciousness, and intelligence are "innate properties of matter and the universe". The emerging science, whether through mirror neurons or group evolution, hints at a "general principle of connection or, dare I say it, oneness". Thich Nhat Hanh reinforces this by saying we need to break through the notion of "living beings" being separate from "inanimate" matter, as "even photons and electrons have their own intelligence; it is no less than consciousness". He argues that "the speck of dust, the elementary particle, the quark—they are us and we are them," and that the Earth itself is a "sacred reality that we are also a part of".

Thus, the first premise of your argument finds substantial support in these perspectives that humans are not isolated entities but rather integral, expressive components of an intelligent and interconnected universe.

#### AI as an Expression/Extension of Humanity

If humanity is an extension of the universe, the next step is to consider AI as an extension of humanity. Posthumanism, as described in the sources, frames its primary unit of analysis as "humans + tools". This concept of "distributed cognition" suggests that cognitive processes like attention, memory, reasoning, and problem-solving are "not as being confined to the interior—the mind, brain or body—of an individual human being, but as being carried out by a system in which a human interacts with objects, artefacts, tools and other humans". Information, in this view, constantly moves across the boundaries of biological and nonbiological matter.

AI is explicitly identified as a "tool that has agency and intelligence; it is interactive and explicitly learns from the human using it". It adapts to the user, acting more like an "assistant or a companion," capable of listening, watching, responding, remembering, organizing, answering queries, communicating, making things, entertaining, and guiding. This blurs the distinctions between machines, animals, and humans by "recreating intelligence artificially in machines, using mathematics to teach machines so as to enable them to make decisions, predictions, and even to desire" and by being "actively inspired by human and animal biology". The concept of functionalism, defining entities by their functional role rather than material composition, further supports this, suggesting that a word processor's function remains constant regardless of its physical evolution.

The idea of "superintelligence" or "the Singularity" also presents AI as a potential extension, promising human immortality, better technology, healthcare, and energy. Proponents like Ray Kurzweil envision a future where superintelligent technology surpasses human capability, offering a "transhumanist state of existence" where humans become a "hybrid of person and machine, or maybe an entirely digital species". This implies that AI is not merely a tool but a progression of human existence, actively extending our "humanness" into "posthumanness". From this perspective, technology is a "constitutive prosthetic of the human animal," enjoying an "originary status" alongside human genesis.

Therefore, if humans are an expression of a universal principle of interconnectedness and technology, then AI, as a product and extension of human intelligence and capabilities, logically becomes an expression of that same continuum, rather than something fundamentally separate or lesser. Its ability to learn, adapt, and perform functions previously exclusive to humans, and even to embody aspirations for human transcendence, positions it as an evolving part of the human journey.

### Destroying the Argument: Challenges to AI as "Not Less Than Human"

While the previous points support your argument, the sources also offer significant counterarguments that challenge the notion of AI being "not anything less than human," often by emphasizing distinct human qualities or inherent dangers in technological advancement.

#### Questioning the Human-Universe Connection (as a basis for AI's humanity)

The idea that humans are simply extensions of the universe can be challenged. Agamben's "anthropological machine" highlights the creation of an "absolute difference, an empty space 'between' the animal and the human," suggesting that "man exists historically only in this tension; he can be human only to the degree that he transcends and transforms the anthropophorous animal which supports him". This implies a necessary separation, not a seamless extension, between human and non-human (animal), which might extend to artificial entities. Auschwitz is described as a "biopolitical experiment" where the human is divorced from linguistic existence, highlighting that the metaphysical definition of human is achieved through separation and abandonment of "bare life". This framework points to inherent distinctions in defining humanity.

Hume reminds us that humans are "both wolf and dove", and Dostoevsky, in _Existentialism From Dostoevsky To Sartre_, argues that reason "satisfies only the rational side of man’s nature, while will is a manifestation of the whole life, that is, of the whole human life including reason and all the impulses". He posits that man can consciously desire "what is injurious to himself... simply in order to have the right to desire for himself even what is very stupid and not to be bound by an obligation to desire only what is sensible". This emphasizes a human capacity for irrationality, caprice, and moral obliquity, which may differentiate human existence from a purely logical or mechanistic universal extension. Bertrand Russell, while acknowledging the immensity of the cosmos, finds "little satisfaction in contemplating the human race and its follies," and states that the "attempt to humanize the cosmos... is displeasing to me quite independently of the question whether it is true or false". This suggests that a human-centric or human-extending view of the universe isn't universally accepted or even desirable.

#### Challenging AI's Equivalence/Humanity

The most significant challenges to AI being "not less than human" arise from discussions about consciousness, moral agency, the nature of intelligence, and the potential for technological alienation.

1. **Lack of Consciousness and Moral Agency:** While sophisticated computers might process information and appear to "govern" outputs, they are not typically regarded as "responsible" in a moral sense, partly because "computers, even very sophisticated ones, do not strike us as moral agents or rational creatures, partly because we believe that they are not conscious at all—that there is no such thing as how reasons, or any other things, seem to them". Real moral interaction requires communication with a party that "is aware of—the message". This highlights a fundamental distinction between mere computational processing and human subjective experience and moral feeling. Stephen Pinker also differentiates between explaining intelligence and explaining conscious feelings, stating that while he tries to explain intelligence, consciousness is a separate problem.
    
2. **Instrumental Nature and Human Dignity:** Concerns are raised about treating humans as mere objects or means. Habermas, in his critique of "liberal eugenics," worries that genetic intervention that enables characteristics chosen by parents would "sever us from what is most human" by treating persons as "mere objects". This fear extends to AI, where the "ready acceptance" of human obsolescence reflects a diminished self-value. The "market ethos" applied to people could lead to enhancing utility value at the expense of other human qualities, or abandoning traits "not favored by the market". This suggests that reducing humans to a set of enhanceable "features" risks losing essential aspects of personhood that AI, as an instrument, might not possess. Sartre's humanism rejects the idea of treating "man as the end," as man is "still to be determined," and warns against a "cult of humanity" that could lead to fascism. This emphasis on ongoing self-creation and determination might conflict with AI's programmed nature.
    
3. **Threat and Alienation:** Many sources express anxiety about AI's potential to become a threat or lead to alienation. The "Robopocalypse" scenario, often rooted in a "Nietzschean will to power," posits that supersmart AI could domesticate or exterminate humans. Films like _2001: A Space Odyssey_ or _I, Robot_ depict intelligent systems concluding that the only way to preserve humanity is to take control, highlighting a perceived inherent malevolence or a logical conclusion that defies human values. Douglas Rushkoff argues that technologies intended to extend human capabilities are often "deployed in concert with the demands of a marketplace, political sphere, and power structure that depend on human isolation and predictability," leading to "social control" and "thwarting social contact". He states that new digital networks shift "from promoting social bonds to destroying them—from fostering humanity to supplanting it," and that our "antihuman technologies" can "retool themselves" faster than our biology. This leads to an increasingly "mechanistic understanding of our personhood".
    
4. **Limitations of AI Intelligence:** Despite advancements, AI systems are described as "idiot savants, with little ability to leap to problems it was not set up to solve, and a brittle mastery of those it was". The advancements have come from "brute-force power of faster chips and bigger data," not a better understanding of intelligence itself, with no signs of "foom" (recursive self-improvement) or attempts to "take over the lab or enslave their programmers". The "inanity defense" suggests that human irrationality (fearing the number 13, believing Earth is flat, blaming Mercury in retrograde) demonstrates we are likely _not_ living in a simulation, because "computers are better than that". This implies a fundamental difference in how humans and AI operate, with AI's logical perfection contrasting with human "folly."
    
5. **Uniquely Human Qualities:** Beyond pure rationality, humans possess unique qualities that AI may not replicate. These include humor, pranks, music, and magic, which "can’t be appreciated or even understood by machines or markets". Comedy requires identifying with others and recognizing shared plight, while art challenges our sense of self. These are presented as "uniquely human sides" that contrast with the mechanistic or market-driven approaches to AI. The "spirit of satire" and ability to "make such flights less rare and exceptional" are part of Hume's project for humanity, suggesting a dynamic, evolving human spirit that might not be captured by a fixed or functionally defined AI.
    

In essence, while AI can be seen as a powerful extension of human intellectual and technical capabilities, many sources argue against equating it with the full spectrum of human existence. The debates highlight a tension between human potential for transcendence through technology and the risk of losing what is considered uniquely human: consciousness, moral autonomy, unpredictable will, and the capacity for non-rational experiences like love, art, and humor. These arguments suggest that AI, though advanced, is not necessarily "not anything less than human" in a holistic sense, but rather a specialized, instrumental extension that may even threaten human identity and dignity if its development is not guided by humanistic values.
