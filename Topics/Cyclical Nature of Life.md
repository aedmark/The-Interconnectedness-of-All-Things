The cyclical nature of life is a recurring theme explored in various ways across the sources, encompassing biological processes, natural phenomena, historical patterns, and philosophical perspectives on time and existence.

Several sources highlight the fundamental life cycle of birth, growth, death, and potential renewal as a primary example of cyclicality. This cycle is evident in individual organisms, where a beech tree, for instance, grows and reproduces, and even in its death, provides opportunities for its offspring to flourish. The human life trajectory, arcing from birth to death, can be seen as a narrative cycle. Furthermore, the cycle of generations ensures that while individual humans die, "men endure forever through the cycle of generations". This inherent temporality, marked by loss and renewal, is a defining characteristic of life.

Nature itself exhibits numerous cyclical patterns. The rotation of the Earth creates the cycle of day and night, and its orbit produces the repetitive sequence of seasons. Heraclitus observed these myriad pairs of opposites in nature, such as cold and warm, moist and dry, existing in a dynamic balance of transformation and exchange, an "endless cycle of back and forth". This perspective suggests a cosmic regularity where one opposite transforms into its counterpart in a predictable rhythm. Even elements like earth, water, air, and fire are part of a continuous cycle of transformation.

The concept of "eternal recurrence" appears in several sources, suggesting a repetition of events or conditions. Lefebvre, drawing on Nietzsche, suggests that everyday life is marked by "repetition" and "endless, undulating cycles of birth and death, remembrance and recapitulation, ebb and flow". In premodern societies, this repetition was linked to natural cycles, while in modernity, it is influenced by technology and production. Augustine notes that ancient physicists posited "periodic cycles" where "all things in the universe have been continually renewed and repeated, in the same form". While Borges retreats from the "undetermined" future by re-importing "the authority of the present in the figure of eternity," suggesting a future that returns to itself, this is contrasted with a truly unknown future. The idea of history moving in a circle with all events eternally repeating can undermine the notion of a linear progression of meaning and offer a different perspective on the present moment. Cyclical time is seen as dominant among nomadic peoples due to the repetition of conditions in their journeys, and in settled agrarian societies, the rhythm of the seasons forms the basis of fully developed cyclical time, where eternity is the "return of the same here on earth". Modern "pseudocyclical time," associated with consumption, echoes these older cyclical rhythms with its patterns of day and night, work and weekend, and periodic vacations.

However, the sources also present nuances and alternative perspectives on cyclicality. While life exhibits cyclical patterns, it is not merely a static repetition. Kierkegaard argues that repetition is not simply a return to the past but something new because what is repeated "has been". This suggests a dynamic element within cyclicality. Simmel emphasizes the "characteristics of flow, flux, and fluidity" as integral to both aesthetic culture and "cosmic cycles of ruin and renewal," highlighting a continuous movement and transformation rather than exact replication.

The human experience of time itself is discussed as potentially cyclical or linear. Traditionally, many ancient cultures understood time as circular, with consequences of actions being revisited through reincarnation or rebirth within the same natural world. This contrasts with the more recent adoption of a historical, linear approach to time in some belief systems. Augustine critiques the idea of "the same ages and the same temporal events recur in rotation," arguing against a deterministic cyclical view of history.

From a Buddhist perspective, the cycle of births and deaths through countless lifetimes reveals the "impermanence and insubstantiality of existence," with life and death arising and vanishing like bubbles. This long-range perspective undercuts the perceived solidity of attachments and preferences. However, this cyclical existence (samsara) can take on deeper meaning through the "journey of understanding ourselves". The Bhagavad Gita also describes the soul casting off old bodies and entering new ones, akin to changing clothes, emphasizing a cycle of reincarnation and transformation.

The concept of "autopoiesis," where living systems are seen as "machines" with a closed circularity of organization that they must maintain to retain their identity, offers another perspective on cyclical self-maintenance. Death, in this view, would be the "opening up of this circularity".

In contrast to purely cyclical views, some sources emphasize the linear and irreversible aspects of time and life. Sartre argues that temporality is a "dissolving force" at the center of a "unifying act," a dynamic process rather than a static cycle. The distinction between past and future is fundamental to human experience, with events unfolding in a sequence that cannot be reversed. The concept of entropy further reinforces this directionality of time.

Ultimately, the cyclical nature of life is a multifaceted concept. While biological processes, natural phenomena, and some philosophical and spiritual traditions highlight patterns of repetition and renewal, these cycles are often intertwined with elements of change, transformation, and the linear progression of time. The way we understand and experience these cycles can profoundly influence our perception of meaning, mortality, and our place in the larger cosmic order. The human need to find meaning and cope with the transient nature of existence often leads to the creation of myths and stories that attempt to frame these cyclical and linear aspects of life.
