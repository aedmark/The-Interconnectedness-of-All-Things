"Invulnerabilism" is a fascinating philosophical position that offers a distinct perspective on how we relate to the world and its potential for causing suffering.

At its core, Invulnerabilism is defined as the stance that it is possible and desirable to make oneself invulnerable to the world's "predations". It's not about avoiding superficial discomforts like stubbing a toe – the pain from that is certainly real and unavoidable regardless of one's philosophy. Instead, Invulnerabilism targets the deeper suffering, the kind that can truly shake us, aiming to achieve a state where one is not vulnerable to being profoundly affected by external events or conditions.

Various philosophical traditions are associated with this idea, including notable ones from both Eastern and Western thought. Buddhism and Taoism are mentioned as Eastern doctrines that align with Invulnerabilism, while Stoicism and potentially Epicureanism are linked to it in the West. A contemporary figure, Eckhart Tolle, is also presented as offering a modern version of invulnerabilism. While these different traditions might arrive at their perspectives through varied paths, they are seen as leading toward a similar goal of invulnerability. Some of these earlier forms of invulnerabilism are noted as being grounded in specific cosmological views, such as Buddhism's grounding in the concept of the One or the Void, and Taoism's in merging with the earth.

A significant focus within invulnerabilist philosophies, as discussed in the sources, is grappling with death. Different invulnerabilist perspectives offer ways to become comfortable with mortality, whether through beliefs in rebirth, the idea of merging with the earth, or rational arguments like Epicurus's point that "where death is, we are not". The overarching aim is to navigate existence, including facing death, without the vulnerability that often accompanies these aspects of life.

One key insight into Invulnerabilism is that it represents a deliberate "project". Unlike vulnerability, which is described as a natural human state unless actively countered, living invulnerably requires conscious effort, discipline, and training. For those who choose this path, it often becomes a fundamental, central aspect of their identity – a "ground project" that permeates various areas of life. The result of this project is often characterized by a state of equanimity or serenity, maintaining composure even when confronted with suffering.

However, the sources don't just present Invulnerabilism; they also explore its limitations and raise questions about its desirability for most people. The text suggests there might be compelling reasons why many, perhaps most, people might not desire the kind of invulnerability these philosophies promise.

Four specific areas are highlighted as points of resistance or reasons for questioning Invulnerabilism: politics, death (again, but from a critical angle), failure, and loss. Let's touch on these:

- **Politics:** Invulnerabilist doctrines raise questions about how one should face injustice in the world. A concern is that by aiming to remove distress as a primary emotion, these philosophies might eliminate a crucial source of motivation for political action against injustice, potentially leading to political inertia. They are seen by some as narrowing the spectrum of human emotional response.
- **Death:** While dealing with death is a core concern for invulnerabilism, the vulnerable perspective questions the detached comfort it might counsel, suggesting that grief in the face of death isn't just weakness but a display of human caring.
- **Failure:** Similar to death, a purely invulnerable response to failure (perhaps a detached shrug) might be seen as lacking the human caring that vulnerability allows. The sources suggest that for most people, caring naturally implies vulnerability in the face of potential failure.
- **Loss:** (This reason is mentioned in the list but not elaborated upon in the provided text beyond its inclusion with death and failure as examples of where a vulnerable life differs from an invulnerable one).

Another critique touches on the relationship to the past. Invulnerabilism tends to view concern with the past as unwarranted, focusing instead on the present and extracting lessons for current living. This is contrasted with approaches that allow for actively grappling with past experiences in a more complex, potentially emotionally challenging way.

The sources also ponder whether achieving true invulnerability, as defined by these doctrines, is genuinely possible for most people, suggesting it might push the limits of human capacity. It's suggested that many who identify with invulnerabilist views might not be fully embracing the 'official' form of these philosophies but are instead using their valuable lessons to become _less_ vulnerable, managing their emotional responses rather than eradicating them. They might seek to be less controlled by desires and passions, for instance, rather than transcending them entirely.

In contrast to Invulnerabilism, the concept of "Vulnerabilism" is introduced not as a competing doctrine or project, but largely as a rejection of the invulnerabilist project itself. Vulnerabilism acknowledges and even embraces human fragility and the capacity for being profoundly affected by suffering. While it doesn't prescribe a single way of life, it explores themes related to accepting vulnerability and finding ways to navigate suffering without necessarily seeking complete immunity or becoming utterly overcome by it. It suggests taking insights from invulnerabilism—perhaps ways to handle difficult situations better or achieve a sense of balance—without adopting the core goal of becoming invulnerable.

Ultimately, the discussion of Invulnerabilism in these sources highlights it as a significant philosophical path aimed at achieving serenity by minimizing vulnerability to suffering, rooted in various historical traditions. However, it also opens up further exploration into the practicalities, desirability, and potential human cost of such a project, prompting reflection on whether embracing a degree of vulnerability might be essential to aspects of human experience like caring, political engagement, and grappling with failure and loss. This contrast between seeking invulnerability as a project and accepting vulnerability as a natural state is a key area for deeper thought.
