Understanding the moral foundations of society is a quest that has captivated philosophers for centuries, and contractualism offers a particularly compelling lens through which to explore these intricate questions. At its heart, contractualism posits that the ultimate grounds of morality – the very bedrock of what makes actions right or wrong – can be explained by reference to some form of agreement, whether real or imagined. This approach has a distinguished lineage, with intellectual giants like Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Kant all contributing to its rich history.

However, the world of contractualism is far from monolithic; different models propose varying answers to crucial questions about morality's origins and force. Let's dive into the fascinating distinctions and shared threads among Hobbesian, Kantian, Rawlsian (justice as fairness), Scanlonian, and deliberative contractualism.

### The Big Picture: What Contractualisms Share (and How They Differ)

Before we dissect the individual theories, it’s worth noting that all contractualist theories give a privileged role to "agreements"—processes involving multiple individuals making decisions about how to act in the world. They also share the ambition of accounting for morality's foundations, which means providing an ultimate, constitutive explanation for moral facts.

However, contractualist theories can diverge in significant ways:

- **The Specific Question Addressed:** Some aim to explain morality's ultimate foundations, while others might focus on providing an epistemic guide, analyzing moral concepts, or offering a causal explanation. For instance, a theory might only aim to account for our duties to other persons, not all moral relationships.
- **The Contractors:** Who is involved in the agreement? Are they actual or hypothetical? What are their characteristics and circumstances?.
- **The Object of Agreement:** What are they agreeing to? Specific actions, a state, laws, shared dispositions, or conduct-constraining principles?.

Historically, two main models have been thoroughly developed: the Hobbesian model, centered on self-interested bargaining, and the Kantian model, focusing on morally constrained agreement among free and equal persons.

### Hobbesian Contractualism: Morality from Self-Interest

**Core Idea:** Hobbesian contractualism sees morality as a compromise, emerging from rational, self-interested individuals who realize that unrestrained pursuit of their own gain leads to an undesirable "state of nature". To escape this, they agree to principles that guarantee cooperation and make everyone better off. Practical reason, focused on individual benefit, is central to both the need for and the possibility of morality in this view.

**Gauthier's Refinement:** David Gauthier's version is often considered a prominent example. While Hobbes himself envisioned actual historical agreements leading to an unfettered sovereign and allowing individuals to bring acquired goods (even by force or fraud) to the bargaining table, Gauthier seeks to avoid these problematic implications. Hobbesian contractualists attempt to explain morality from a "normatively modest starting point," often making assumptions about "equal rationality" and "initial endowments" to ensure explanatory adequacy.

**Limitations (Critique):** Despite its appeal for deriving morality from a simple starting point, Hobbesian contractualism faces significant challenges in accurately capturing what we intuitively understand as morality:

1. **Lack of "Other-Regardingness" (Normativity Objection):** This model struggles to vindicate the platitude that moral reasons are inherently _other-regarding_.
    - Reasons to act morally are fundamentally instrumental and subjective, based on an agent's self-interest or desires. For instance, one avoids torturing others not out of genuine concern for them, but because it's the best way to satisfy one's _own_ goals.
    - It cannot genuinely account for emotions like guilt and remorse; these would, at best, be elaborate charades for placating others, or mere instances of intense anger or disappointment directed at oneself.
    - Similarly, the reasons for non-agents to blame or punish wrongdoers become problematic, as they wouldn't stem from an intrinsic wrong but from a utility calculation or a need to secure future cooperation.
2. **Failure of Impartiality (Impartiality Objection):** Hobbesian contractualism fails to justify the idea that all sane adult humans have moral standing, regardless of their power, wealth, or strength.
    - An individual's moral rights are contingent on whether it is in the _interest_ of others to grant them such rights. This implies that "Truly Powerless" individuals might have no inherent moral rights against the powerful.
    - The view can lead to moral relativism, as moral principles would be relative to specific political systems or local cooperation arrangements, undermining morality's universality and objectivity.

**Conclusion:** Hobbesian contractualism is often criticized for being "morally inaccurate" despite potentially being "explanatorily adequate." It gets morality _wrong in the right way_, offering a picture where the "moral point of view" is subjective, personal, and partial, with others figuring only as contingent inputs for one's own benefit.

### Kantian Contractualism (and Rawls's Justice as Fairness): Morality from Rationality and Mutual Respect

**Core Idea (General Kantian):** This model originates from Immanuel Kant's work, particularly his categorical imperative, which suggests that individuals should "act in accordance with the maxims of a member giving universal laws for a merely possible kingdom of ends". It proposes hypothetical agreements among individuals who see themselves and one another as free, equal, and worthy of moral respect, rather than self-interested bargainers. Kant views moral principles as public legislation for an "ethical commonwealth".

**Rawls's Justice as Fairness:** John Rawls's "justice as fairness" is a powerful and influential contemporary example, generalizing the social contract tradition found in Locke, Rousseau, and Kant.

- **The Original Position and Veil of Ignorance:** Rawls introduces the "original position," an initial state of equality where free and rational individuals, aiming to further their own interests, would choose principles for society's basic structure. Crucially, they do this behind a "veil of ignorance," which prevents them from knowing their social position, natural advantages, or specific values. This ensures fairness, as no one can tailor principles to benefit themselves at others' expense.
- **Moral Persons and Sense of Justice:** The parties in the original position are understood as "moral persons"—rational beings with their own ends but also capable of a "sense of justice" that limits acceptable conceptions of the good. They also have "highest-order interests" in maintaining their liberty to revise their ends.
- **Principles of Justice:** These principles regulate all future agreements, social cooperation, and forms of government. Rawls argues that this process would lead to two specific principles of justice, contrasting sharply with utilitarianism.
- **Contrast with Utilitarianism:** Rawls's theory stands as a constructive alternative to utilitarianism, which he sees as dominating philosophical tradition despite its persistent misgivings. Utilitarianism extends the principle of choice for one person to society and seeks to maximize the satisfaction of a constructed system of desires, often treating justice as a socially useful illusion. Rawls, by contrast, embeds ideals of justice directly into his first principles, offering a more definite and clear structure for moral decision-making.
- **Kantian Interpretation:** The original position is an attempt to interpret Kant's idea of individuals as free and equal rational beings. The "publicity condition" for principles of justice, meaning everyone would know about them, is implicit in Kant's categorical imperative.
- **Scope:** Rawls initially expressed optimism about extending "rightness as fairness" to individual conduct but later retreated, focusing primarily on principles of justice for the basic structure of society, not a complete ethical system for all moral relationships or virtues, such as duties to animals.
- **Methodology:** Rawls employs the method of "reflective equilibrium," where principles are justified by showing they align with our "considered judgments" about justice.

**Scanlon's Contractualism:** T.M. Scanlon offers another influential version of Kantian contractualism, specifically designed to account for the morality of individual conduct, or "what we owe to each other".

- **Justifiability to Others:** Scanlon's core idea is that an act is wrong if it would be disallowed by any principles for general behavior that _no one could reasonably reject_ as a basis for informed, unforced general agreement. This notion of justifiability is taken as basic, shaping specific moral notions and accounting for morality's normative force.
- **Motivation and Reasonableness:** The motivational basis is the desire to find principles that others, similarly motivated, could not reasonably reject—a shared willingness to modify private demands. Scanlon explicitly uses "reasonableness" rather than "rationality" (which he sees as commonly defined as fulfilling agent's aims). Reasonableness in this context involves making substantive judgments about the merits of claims and the suitability of principles for mutual recognition.
- **Principles as Reasons:** Principles are general conclusions about the status of reasons for action, not rigid rules, allowing for judgment and interpretation. They rule out some actions by ruling out reasons that would support them.
- **Scope of "What We Owe to Each Other":** This part of morality covers conscious beings capable of "judgment-sensitive attitudes" to whom we have reason to want our actions to be justifiable. It's a central part of morality but not exhaustive of all "moral" considerations, acknowledging a "plurality of values" (e.g., friendship, professional excellence, sexual values) that go beyond what we strictly "owe to each other".

**Limitations (Critique of Kantian/Scanlonian):** While addressing many of the shortcomings of Hobbesian contractualism, Kantian/Scanlonian approaches face different criticisms concerning their foundational claims:

1. **Explanatory Inadequacy:** These models are often critiqued for failing the "explanatory adequacy criterion," meaning they get morality _right in the wrong way_.
2. **Circularity Objection:** The notion of "reasonableness" in Scanlon's theory, or the very setup of Rawls's original position, is argued to implicitly contain the moral content it's supposed to explain. Critics suggest that the theory smuggles in moral elements at the outset, making it seem plausible but telling us little new. For instance, to say a principle is "unfair" (and therefore reasonably rejectable) already presupposes a moral judgment about equality, rather than deriving it.
3. **Non-Fundamentality Objection:** Even if explanatory, these theories are considered "explanatorily non-fundamental." They presuppose "contract-independent reasons" that are prior to and more fundamental than the contractual situation itself. Scanlon's contractors, for example, track pre-existing reasons about what is good or bad, rather than creating them. The contractual apparatus is thus parasitic on these more fundamental normative considerations, not the ultimate ground. Blackburn and Pettit raise this by asking, if a principle leads to vast inequalities, isn't the inequality itself what makes it wrong, rather than the hypothetical agreement?.

### Deliberative Contractualism: Morality from Deliberative Agency

**Core Idea:** Nicholas Southwood's deliberative contractualism seeks to transcend the limitations of both Hobbesian and Kantian models. It proposes that morality's foundations lie in what common code we would agree to live by if we were _perfectly deliberatively rational_.

**Key Features:**

1. **Deliberative Rationality:** This is a _procedural_ rather than _substantive_ conception of rationality. It involves engaging in deliberation with _affected others_, fully complying with specific communicative, discursive, and reflective norms, and basing decisions on the outcome of this process.
2. **Interpersonal Point of View:** This model aims for a genuinely _interpersonal_ perspective, avoiding the extreme partiality of Hobbesian views and the potential "oppressively impersonal" nature of some Kantian interpretations. It acknowledges others not just as claim-makers but as fellow participants in shaping shared claims, emphasizing mutual understanding and accountability.
3. **Relational Formalism (Normativity):** The normativity of deliberative contractualism is explained through "reasons of deliberative citizenship". This is a "relational formalist" account: reasons are normative expressions of a relation (deliberative citizenship) that is _entailed by our deliberative agency_, applying irrespective of individual desires or external values. These reasons are "other-regarding all the way down," meaning they inherently involve accountability to others.
    - This directly addresses Hobbesian failures by grounding moral reasons in reciprocal accountability, not self-interest.
    - It accounts for guilt, remorse, blame, and punishment as fitting responses to violations of these shared expectations and demands of deliberative citizenship.
4. **Inputs to Deliberation:** Unlike Hobbesian reliance on desires or Kantian reliance on objective reasons, deliberative contractualism allows the _full range of attitudes_ constituting individuals' "first-personal standpoints" as inputs, including normative judgments. This allows for "deliberative transformation" where normative judgments can be challenged and refined through intersubjective scrutiny. Moral judgments can be inputs, but they won't automatically hold sway without deeper explanation of their underlying importance.
5. **Output: A Common Code:** The aim is to agree on a "common code" to live by—a comprehensive set of general principles. This is assumed to happen under conditions of _ideal compliance and acceptance_ within the hypothetical situation. The principles are not rigid rules but general conclusions that require judgment and discretion in application.
6. **Inclusion (Broad and Narrow):**
    - **Democratic Criterion (Broad):** All individuals _affected_ by the principles (including the severely mentally disabled, non-adults, and non-human animals through representatives) are included. This ensures non-contingent and non-derivative moral status for atypical persons.
    - **Liberal Criterion (Narrow):** Only _deliberatively competent_ individuals (those capable of being subject to the principles) are included in the narrow sense.
    - Southwood argues there's no inconsistency here, as "inclusion" has different meanings in the broad and narrow senses.
7. **Moral Accuracy (Intensional and Extensional):**
    - **Normativity and Objectivity:** Deliberative contractualism claims to account for morality's minimal normativity, its authority (categoricity and bindingness without relying on desires), and its profound other-regardingness. It also aims to vindicate objectivity by being non-subjective (allowing genuine right/wrong answers), universal (common code for a generation), non-arbitrary (due to deliberative rationality), and epistemically accessible through actual deliberation.
    - **Partiality and Impartiality:** It seeks to account for both justified partiality (e.g., to family and friends) and universal impartiality (e.g., universal patiential rights) within an integrated framework. It addresses discrepancies in power and deep cultural disagreements not through a "veil of ignorance" but through the force of "persuasion and the better argument" under deliberative constraints, ensuring that arbitrary differences don't hold sway.
    - **Duties of Aid and Atypical Persons:** It would yield principles for duties of aid to ensure a basic standard of living and gives atypical persons non-contingent moral status by including them as "representees" in the deliberation.
8. **Explanatory Adequacy:** Deliberative contractualism argues it avoids the pitfalls of other theories:
    - **Not Backwards:** It maintains that principles are valid _because_ they are agreed to in the deliberative situation, not the other way around.
    - **Not Circular:** The deliberative norms are procedural, not inherently moral, and we have an independent grasp of them. The inclusion criteria and the "common code" constraint are justified internally or as output conditions, not as smuggled-in moral content.
    - **Not Epiphenomenal or Non-fundamental:** It asserts that the reasons for agreement are a _product_ of deliberation, not prior, immutable, external facts. It claims to reach "explanatory rock-bottom," explaining everything that needs explaining within its framework.

### Scanlonian vs. Deliberative Contractualism: A Closer Look

While both Scanlon's and deliberative contractualism are Kantian-inspired, the subtle yet crucial differences lie in their approach to practical reason and normativity.

- **Practical Reason:** Scanlon's theory uses a _substantive_ conception of practical reason, meaning that "reasonableness" already has moral content, and the contractors track pre-existing moral reasons. Deliberative contractualism, by contrast, employs a _procedural_ conception of deliberative rationality; the norms are about _how_ to deliberate properly, not _what_ substantive moral conclusions to reach a priori.
- **Normativity:** Scanlon's normativity leans towards _substantivism_, where reasons explain a "particular form of value" that we respect by acting rightly. The contractual situation tracks reasons that are "prior to and independent" of the agreement. Deliberative contractualism proposes _relational formalism_, where reasons are normative expressions of the relation of "deliberative citizenship" that arises from our shared deliberative agency, independent of desires or external values. This means that for Scanlon, the "unreasonableness" of an action (e.g., causing unfair imposition) _is_ the reason, whereas for deliberative contractualism, the reason is rooted in the demands of the "deliberative citizenship" relationship itself.

In essence, Scanlon's model starts with an already morally informed notion of reasonableness, making the contractual process an interpretive tool for uncovering these reasons. Deliberative contractualism aims to derive morality from the very nature of ideal deliberation and the relationships it entails, thereby attempting to build the moral content more directly from its foundational process.

The journey through these contractualist philosophies reveals a rich and ongoing debate about the bedrock of morality. While Hobbesian contractualism grounds morality in self-interest (and struggles with its moral accuracy), Kantian and Rawlsian views elevate rationality, fairness, and mutual respect as central. Scanlon refines this by focusing on principles that no one could _reasonably_ reject, grounding moral reasons in a substantive understanding of value. Finally, deliberative contractualism attempts a novel path, deriving morality's foundations from the procedural demands of perfect deliberation and the unique "deliberative citizenship" it fosters, aiming for a theory that is both morally accurate and explanatorily fundamental without resorting to pre-existing moral content in its initial setup. Each approach grappling with the profound question of how we, as humans, come to acknowledge and adhere to a common moral framework.
