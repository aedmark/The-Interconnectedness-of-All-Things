**Fate:**

The concept of fate is presented in various ways across the sources, ranging from deterministic forces to personal destinies shaped by both internal and external factors.

*   **Determinism vs. Agency:** Several sources grapple with the tension between fate as a predetermined course and the possibility of free will. The idea that "all future events were nevertheless somehow preordained and destined to take place" was a prevalent scientific view before the quantum revolution. Laplace's concept of a superhuman intelligence predicting all future states based on present conditions exemplifies this deterministic view, which stands "at odds with determinism" and the necessity of free will for a meaningful existence. Similarly, the ancient Greeks believed "that the fates controlled their destiny," and Calvinists believed "that God had fixed in advance everything that was going to happen". However, some philosophers suggest that believing in only freedom or only fatalism might be a "real illusion," and perhaps both can coexist.

*   **Fate as Opportunity and Limitation:** Heidegger connects fate to Dasein's "historizing," where Dasein chooses one of its possibilities in the present, and this possibility becomes its fate. This suggests that fate is not merely imposed but is also tied to the choices made within the horizon of one's being. Habermas, drawing on Arendt, describes "fate" as that which limits freedom, something entwined with an origin beyond human disposal, like nature or God. This is contrasted with the capacity to begin something new through action, linked to the significance of birth.

*   **Fate and Amor Fati:** Deleuze, referencing Nietzsche, speaks of destiny as the "necessity of chance" and connects this to *amor fati*, the love or acceptance of fate, or "that which simply is". Bourdieu also mentions Spinoza's concept of *amor fati*, equating reconciliation with one's fate to reconciliation with God as the ultimate resolution of natural forces.

*   **Fate in Mythology and Religion:** Several sources touch upon mythological and religious understandings of fate. In Plato's myth, the Fates (Moirai) are depicted arranging the lots of lives. Hillman elaborates on this, stating that the Fates signify that "all happenings form a unity and are spun together". He also mentions the myth of souls choosing their lives and being assigned a daimon and their destiny being ratified by the Fates. Tippett notes that religious traditions often address the "inevitability of death," which can be seen as a fundamental aspect of fate. Weber discusses the Calvinist theory of predestination and its impact on behavior.

*   **Szondi's Fate Analysis:** Kovary provides a detailed account of Szondi's theory of fate analysis, which posits fate as the "dialectic coexistence of fateful compulsion" (related to familial unconscious and heritage) and "fateful choice" (related to the conscious self). Szondi believed that fateful compulsion unconsciously determines major life choices, while the "pontifex self" has the power to shape one's fate through self-awareness and the ability to humanize and transcend instinctual impulses. Szondi saw the familial unconscious as expressing itself through choices in love, friendship, occupation, and illness/death. He even quotes Heidegger on "repeating" inherited possibilities of fate arising from the familial unconscious.

*   **Fate as a Portion (Moira):** Hillman emphasizes the Greek concept of *moira*, the word for fate, meaning "a share, a portion". This suggests that fate is not absolute control but rather a part of what happens in life, with the individual also bearing responsibility for their actions and abilities. *Moira* is derived from roots meaning "to ponder, to think, meditate, consider, care," highlighting its psychological dimension.

*   **Fate and Character:** Hillman also touches upon Heraclitus' dictum, "Character is fate," suggesting a strong link between one's inherent nature and the course of one's life. Benjamin similarly states that "when 'character' speaks it breaks with fate".

**Calling:**

The idea of "calling" is presented as a powerful inner force or external influence that directs an individual towards a particular path or purpose.

*   **The "Acorn Theory":** Hillman's "acorn theory" centers around the idea that "each person bears a uniqueness that asks to be lived and that is already present before it can be lived". This "call" can manifest as a signal moment in childhood, a fascination, or a sense of destiny. The book is about this call, the sense of fate associated with it, and the power of character in realizing it.

*   **The Daimon and Other Analogous Concepts:** Hillman discusses various terms used throughout history for this "call," including the Roman *genius*, the Greek *daimon*, the Christian guardian angel, and the Romantic idea of a call from the heart. He uses these terms interchangeably, emphasizing the enigmatic force in human life that contemporary psychology often overlooks. The *daimon*, in Plato's myth, is the guardian of life and the fulfiller of one's chosen lot. Hillman suggests the daimon surprises and can influence intentions, often leading to a sense of "fate" afterward.

*   **The Experience of a Calling:** Hillman provides examples of individuals experiencing a powerful call early in life, such as R. G. Collingwood's profound encounter with Kant's ethics, which felt like a revelation of his destiny. This call can be intense and feel like a personal matter of utmost urgency.

*   **Fate and the Pull Towards an End (Teleology):** Hillman connects the "innate image" with a pull towards a specific end, linking "calling" to the concept of teleology, the belief that events are drawn by a purpose. This suggests that the initial call or image carries within it a trajectory or direction for the individual's life.

*   **Response to a Divine or Prophetic Call:** Ricœur discusses the "divine call" and the "prophetic call" in the Christian tradition, where the self is "summoned" and responds through obedience and faith. This concept of a call implies a demand or solicitation that requires a response and recognition of a higher authority. Husserl's lexicon of affectivity also includes the idea of "calling into being of the self," which aligns with this notion of a calling that shapes subjectivity.

**The Relationship Between Fate and Calling:**

The sources suggest a close and complex relationship between fate and calling.

*   **Calling as a Manifestation of Fate:** Hillman's "acorn theory" implies that the innate uniqueness or calling of an individual is intertwined with their fate or destiny. The call is a pre-existing potential that seeks realization, and the unfolding of this potential within the circumstances of life constitutes one's fate. The *daimon* is presented as both the fulfiller of the chosen life and a guiding force behind the calling.

*   **Fate as the Context for Calling:** The "powers and chances of the world" provide the backdrop against which the "gift of freedom" (akin to following one's calling) shapes a life beyond a completely predetermined "Music of the Ainur" (fate) in Tolkien's view. Fate can be seen as the given circumstances and limitations, while calling is the individual's active engagement and shaping of their life within these parameters.

*   **Responsibility Within Fate:** Hillman argues that fate (moira) does not relieve one of responsibility; rather, it calls for more. This implies that even within the constraints of fate, the individual has a role to play in responding to their calling and making choices.

*   **The Unpredictable Interventions of Fate and the Daimon:** The surprises and seemingly irrational moments in life, attributed to fate or the *daimon*, can influence and redirect one's calling, adding an element of unpredictability to the unfolding of destiny.

Fate is a multifaceted concept encompassing deterministic views, the acceptance of what is, limiting circumstances, and personal destinies shaped by both internal potentials and external forces. Calling, on the other hand, is presented as an innate drive or external summons towards a particular path or purpose. The relationship between the two is dynamic, with calling often being understood as a key aspect of one's fate, the active unfolding of inherent potential within the context of life's circumstances. The sources emphasize that even within the realm of fate, individual agency and responsibility, particularly in responding to one's calling, remain crucial.

**1. Fate (or Destiny): The External Force**

* **Definition:** At its core, "fate" refers to a predetermined course of events believed to be beyond human control. It suggests that certain things *will* happen, regardless of individual choices or actions.  It's an external force shaping the narrative of a life.
* **Historical & Cultural Context:**
    * **Ancient Greek Tragedy:** Fate is arguably most famously explored in ancient Greek tragedies (think Sophocles’ *Oedipus Rex*, Euripides’ *Medea*). The characters often struggle against their fate, believing they can avoid it, but ultimately discover that attempts to defy it only lead them directly into its grasp.  The Moirae (the Fates) were goddesses who spun, measured, and cut the thread of life for each person, dictating their lifespan and major events.
    * **Roman Mythology:** The Roman concept of *fatum* is very similar to the Greek understanding of fate.
    * **Religious Perspectives:**  Many religions incorporate elements of predestination or divine will that resemble fate. For example:
        * **Islam:**  The doctrine of Qadar (divine decree) addresses God's knowledge and control over events, which can be interpreted as a form of predetermination. However, there are varying interpretations regarding free will within this framework.
        * **Christianity:** While emphasizing free will, some Christian denominations have historically wrestled with the concept of predestination – the belief that God has already chosen who will be saved.  This is often debated alongside discussions of divine sovereignty and human agency.
    * **Secular Interpretations:** Even outside religious contexts, "fate" can refer to a sense of inevitability or a feeling that events are unfolding according to an unseen plan. This might be attributed to broader historical forces, societal trends, or simply random chance perceived as meaningful.
* **Key Characteristics:**
    * **Impersonal:** Fate is often presented as an impersonal force, not necessarily malicious but indifferent to individual suffering.
    * **Unchangeable (or Resistant to Change):**  The defining characteristic of fate is its apparent inflexibility. Attempts to avoid it are often futile or even self-defeating.
    * **Source of Tragedy:** In literature and philosophy, fate frequently serves as a source of tragic conflict and suffering.

**2. Calling: The Internal Impulse**

* **Definition:** "Calling" refers to a strong feeling that one is meant to do something specific – a vocation, purpose, or mission in life. It's an internal sense of direction, often linked to values, passions, and a desire to contribute meaningfully to the world.
* **Historical & Cultural Context:**
    * **Religious Origins:** The concept of "calling" has deep roots in religious traditions, particularly Protestantism. Martin Luther emphasized the idea that God calls individuals to specific roles within the church and society.  This wasn't just about becoming a pastor; it could be any vocation – a farmer, a craftsman, a ruler – as long as it was pursued with diligence and integrity.
    * **19th & 20th Century Romanticism:** The Romantics emphasized individual expression and the pursuit of authentic selfhood.  "Calling" became associated with finding one's unique place in the world and fulfilling one’s potential. Thinkers like Ralph Waldo Emerson encouraged individuals to "trust their inner voice."
    * **Modern Psychology & Career Counseling:** Contemporary career counseling often uses the language of “calling” to encourage people to find work that aligns with their values and passions, leading to greater job satisfaction and a sense of purpose.  Viktor Frankl's *Man’s Search for Meaning* is highly relevant here – he argued that finding meaning in life (which can be through work or calling) is the primary motivational force in human beings.
* **Key Characteristics:**
    * **Personal & Subjective:** A calling is a deeply personal experience, rooted in individual values and beliefs.
    * **Motivating & Inspiring:**  A sense of calling provides motivation, direction, and often a feeling of profound satisfaction.
    * **Action-Oriented:** While it may begin as an internal feeling, a calling typically leads to action – pursuing education, changing careers, volunteering, or engaging in creative endeavors.

**The Relationship Between Fate & Calling: A Complex Dance**

These two concepts aren't necessarily mutually exclusive; they can exist in tension with each other. Here are some ways they interact:

* **Fate as a Backdrop:**  A belief in fate might influence how someone interprets their calling. If one believes that events are predetermined, the pursuit of a calling might be seen as fulfilling a preordained plan rather than actively shaping one's destiny.
* **Calling as Resistance to Fate:** Conversely, embracing a strong sense of calling can be interpreted as an act of defiance against fate – a conscious effort to shape one’s life and influence events.  The character Oedipus, in his attempts to avoid the prophecy, could be seen as trying to assert his will against a seemingly immutable fate.
* **Reconciling Fate & Calling:** Some philosophical systems attempt to reconcile these concepts by suggesting that while there may be broader patterns or limitations imposed by fate, individuals still have agency within those boundaries to pursue their calling and make meaningful choices.  This often involves finding meaning *within* the framework of what is perceived as inevitable.

**Suggestions for Further Exploration:**

* **Greek Tragedy:** Read Sophocles’ *Oedipus Rex*, Euripides' *Medea,* or Aeschylus’ *Prometheus Bound*. Consider how the characters grapple with their fates.
* **Existentialism:** Explore the works of Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, and Simone de Beauvoir.  These philosophers emphasize individual freedom and responsibility in a seemingly meaningless universe – which can inform discussions about both fate and calling.
* **Viktor Frankl's *Man’s Search for Meaning*:** A powerful exploration of finding purpose even in the face of immense suffering.
* **The Concept of "Ikigai" (Japanese):**  This concept combines passion, mission, vocation, and profession – a holistic approach to finding one’s reason for being. It's closely related to the idea of calling.
* **Stoicism:** Stoic philosophy emphasizes accepting what is beyond our control (fate) while focusing on what we *can* control (our actions and attitudes). This offers a framework for navigating life with resilience and purpose.
