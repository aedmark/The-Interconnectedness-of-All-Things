**Divine Healing and Well-being:**

Several sources describe divine beings or concepts associated with healing and promoting human or cosmic well-being.

- In the Christian context, the sources highlight God and Jesus as Healer. Scripture is said to consistently refer to them this way. God "heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds", and identifies himself as "the Lord, your healer". The work of the Suffering Servant is connected to healing, stating that by his "stripes we are healed". The Gospels recount Jesus' healings, which are seen as showing his continuity with the divine healer of the Old Testament. The Church is exhorted to continue this ministry. It is also noted that by Jesus' wounds, "we have been healed". In Christ, God shares life, health, and well-being that is abundant and complete, leaving believers immune to sickness or decay in the future. Even though God's power may be veiled in the current time, the Church is called to minister to the sick and suffering. Salvation itself is linked to healing and hominization.
- Beyond physical healing, divine entities are linked to spiritual or holistic well-being. Maimonides' medical art is contrasted with Galen's, suggesting Maimonides healed both flesh and spirit, using wisdom to heal the "disease of ignorance". The concept of "canonical" resources in Christian theology are described as "means of grace" akin to "medicine designed to heal and restore human flourishing". Gifts from the triune God, mediated through the church's canonical heritage (like spiritual disciplines, sacraments, creeds), are for the people of God so they may heal and flourish. A religious outlook on life is presented as crucial for healing psychological problems in later life. Finding meaning through a direct relationship with God is described as a path to seeking meaning and health. The word "conscious" (con-scire) is suggested to mean "to know with God," implying that God reveals Herself through the unconscious, and openness to this wisdom allows one to deal with difficult internal material and find connection. The Baha'i text, _The Hidden Words_, states that the "healer of all thine ills is remembrance of Me".
- In ancient Chinese thought, Heaven (Tian) is portrayed as the ultimate, primordial moral source and the source of the moral order. Exemplary rulers patterned themselves on Heaven, and their rituals embodied the fixed patterns of Heaven, allowing them to produce harmonious societies. Heaven is also represented with human emotional qualities and is responsible for sages and proper behavior. High Deities are represented as punishers and rewarders based on moral criteria. Seeking and aligning with the "spirit of Heaven and Earth" through sincerity and reverence is linked to obtaining guidance for favorable actions and avoiding misfortune. Wisdom (Sophia) is described as a divine reality pervading creation and sustaining the world, allowing the sage to discern a path of hope in the face of suffering.
- In other ancient cultures, such as the Babylonian tradition depicted in the _Gilgamesh_ excerpt, diseases were sometimes attributed to divine displeasure. Healing practices involved attempts to identify which god was angry and why, and to deduce and sway the will of the gods through omens, offerings, prayers, and incantations. In ancient Egypt, skills for curing the sick were linked to causing the names of gods to endure, their temples, offerings, and festivals. Prayers for health and long life were addressed to specific gods. Some texts describe the human body as ruled and guarded by deities, and practices involving visualizing these deities or chanting liturgies/mantras were aimed at maintaining health and attaining immortality.
- Folk healing practices described in _The Golden Bough_ sometimes involved interacting with the spiritual realm, such as explaining sickness by the absence of the soul and using rituals to guide it back, or attempting to transfer sickness to other entities or objects. Mao Xing, described as an immortal, was able to heal all sick and injured brought to him, using both herbal medicine and specially prepared pills. Sun Xiyao, a healer, received knowledge about herbs and their use from a snake spirit.

**Patterns, Codes, and Symbols:**

The sources also discuss various forms of patterns, codes, symbols, and specific practices or texts related to knowledge, communication, or interaction, sometimes with a spiritual or divine dimension.

- In the context of the mind and cognitive science, thought is associated with a pattern of brain activity that can be recognized by a computer. The HVC coding system is used to extract psychologically meaningful information from dreams and analyze their content and significance.
- In ancient Chinese thought, "patterned forms" (wen zhang) of rulers were seen as illustrious. The fixed patterns of Heaven were embodied in rituals, allowing for a harmonious society. The patterns of human culture (wen) are said to have emerged from Heaven and to continue through Heaven's allowance.
- Divination practices in the _I Ching_ involve manipulating objects (yarrow stalks, coins, gemstones) to obtain a six-line gua and moving line. These gua structures (trigrams, hexagrams) represent underlying principles or energies, such as Qian representing the perfect yang essence. Interpreting these patterns, informed by terms like yuan, heng, li, and zhen (related to origin, offerings, harvest, and divination), provides guidance obtained by aligning with the spirit of Heaven and Earth. Similarly, Babylonian extispicy involved interpreting deviations in animal entrails, viewed as divine messages or "writing" from the gods, using arcane terminology and symbolic interpretations of organ features.
- Religious and philosophical texts use symbolic language and concepts. _The Hidden Words_ distills spiritual essence and addresses spiritual themes related to achieving virtue and nearness to God. Sacred texts penned by an enlightened mind are said to be a "mirror of the enlightened mind" and can lead to spiritual experience simply by reading them. Mantras are described as spiritual sounds, not physical, heard by the heart and uttered by the mind, and their power depends on the individual's spiritual attitude and knowledge. Sophia (Wisdom) is a divine reality described through personification and concepts related to God's being and work. Gnostic texts speak of an incorruptible realm and Sophia's creative actions, resulting in a lower realm of chaos, described using symbolic language like veil, shadow, aborted fetus, and names like Yaldabaoth. The experience of intelligent divine light is also described.
- Psychological analysis in Jung's work uses symbols and archetypes, such as the cross, quaternity, and mandala, which can have numinous and healing effects and provide access to religious truths. These symbols are often interpreted within the context of reconciling opposites (divine/demonic, light/darkness). The play of signifiers and difference in language is discussed in relation to philosophical concepts.

**Intersection of Divine/Spiritual and Patterns/Practices related to Healing:**

While "Divine Healing Codes" is not a term used, the sources show how divine or spiritual influence related to healing and well-being is sometimes sought, understood, or mediated through structured practices, symbolic interpretations, or specific forms of knowledge.

- Ancient divination practices, like the I Ching or Babylonian extispicy, sought to discern divine will or messages regarding matters including sickness, by interpreting patterns in objects or organs. These can be seen as systems or "codes" for interpreting divine communication, some of which directly relate to health outcomes.
- Religious practices involve rituals, prayers, incantations, visualizations, or the use of specific texts or objects to connect with divine power for healing or flourishing. These practices, sometimes referred to as "means of grace" or "canonical heritage", can be seen as prescribed "codes" of conduct or interaction to receive divine gifts, including healing and sustenance.
- The idea that divine wisdom or knowledge can lead to healing is present. Maimonides' "secret" cures and Sun Xiyao receiving knowledge from a spirit hint at specialized, perhaps divinely imparted or spiritually connected, methods of healing. The concept of "divine wisdom" or "mysterious knowledge" is explicitly linked to release from ill.
- Forgiveness is described as a "divine gift" and a "revelatory possibility" that enables hope and is mediated through imagination. This links a divine action (forgiveness) to a specific human experience and capacity, mediated in a way that opens new possibilities, perhaps suggesting a spiritual "pattern" or "logic of abundance" through which divine grace operates to heal relational or psychological wounds.
