Human existence is a tapestry woven with threads of individual experience and collective belonging. At its core lie two fundamental yet often seemingly contradictory concepts: the interconnected self and agency. We are beings deeply embedded in a web of relationships, shaped by social forces and the presence of others, yet we also possess a profound capacity for self-determination, the ability to influence the course of our lives through our actions and choices. Understanding the intricate interplay between our interconnected nature and our sense of agency is crucial to grasping the richness and complexity of human experience.

The notion of an isolated, purely autonomous self, capable of thinking and acting wholly according to its own reason, has been challenged by various schools of thought. Instead, the sources emphasize the profoundly interconnected nature of the self. Our very identities are forged in dialogue and through interactions with others. As Appiah suggests, "individuality presupposes sociability". We do not develop in isolation but through our relationships, both overt and internal, with others. Taylor highlights that "my discovering my own identity doesn’t mean that I work it out in isolation, but that I negotiate it through dialogue, partly overt, partly internal, with others". This dialogical self underscores the psychological blurring of boundaries between self and other. Bakhtin further emphasizes the "contraposition" of self and other as fundamental to moral philosophy, highlighting our commingling in the ongoing event of Being and our equal participation in a shared lifeworld. In order to even perceive ourselves as coherent entities, we require the "vision of others," as "it is only the other’s categories that will let me be an object for my own perception". We "author ourselves" by conceiving how others might see us.

This interconnectedness extends beyond mere social influence. Our experiences are inherently intersubjective. As Marsiglio notes, "our encounters with we-ness are woven into the routines and rituals that penetrate our daily lives". These moments of belonging shape our disposition and outlook on what it means to be part of a group or excluded from one. Even our understanding of the world is influenced by shared perspectives and cultural contexts. Maibom suggests that a significant part of our experiences consists of features that most human beings share, allowing us to adopt another's point of view and gain a fundamentally different understanding of their world. The original mode of accessing others, according to Husserl, is empathy, through which we relate to a second ego and its life, forming a "communalization" and an "I-thou-oneness". Thus, the self is not a self-contained ego but is fundamentally oriented towards and constituted in relation to others.

Alongside this inherent interconnectedness, human beings possess a crucial capacity for agency. Agency, in its simplest form, is the degree to which a subject can determine the course of their own actions. It implies a sense of "response ability," the capacity to freely take responsibility for our existence and exercise choice in essential decisions affecting our lives. The feeling that we are the authors of our thoughts and actions, that we deliberate and choose, is a fundamental aspect of our experience. Even though we may not have conscious access to all the neurophysiological processes underlying our choices, these processes are still part of who we are as individuals.

However, the exercise of agency is not without its constraints. As Marx famously put it, "people make history, but not in conditions of their own choosing". Our levels of wealth, social circumstances, and even the unconscious aspects of our psyche can significantly impact the degree of agency we possess. Moreover, external forces and societal expectations can exert considerable influence, potentially leading to an "inauthentic existence" if one's actions are driven by motives alien to their own values. Bauman highlights how the conditions under which individuals construct their lives often retreat beyond their conscious influence, even as they attempt to create coherent narratives of self.

The dynamic interplay between the interconnected self and agency is where the richness of human experience truly lies. Our agency is not exercised in a vacuum but within the context of our relationships and social worlds. Our choices are often informed by the anticipated judgments of others. While this can be a constraint, our connections also provide the very fabric within which our agency finds meaning and expression. The desire to contribute to a larger whole, to act out of concern for the common good, can be a powerful motivator for exercising our autonomy.

Furthermore, the recognition and affirmation we receive from others are crucial for the full realization of our subjectivity and agency. Benjamin argues that "the other must be recognized as another subject in order for the self to fully experience his or her subjectivity in the other’s presence". This intersubjective validation is essential for our sense of self-worth and our ability to act confidently in the world.

The quest for authenticity, for being true to oneself, is deeply intertwined with both interconnectedness and agency. While some notions of authenticity emphasize introspection and the discovery of an inner essence, others, like the socio-existential approach, understand the authentic self as created through choice and commitment within a social context. This perspective recognizes that our choices are made within "intersubjective horizons of significance" and are shaped by our heritage and interactions. Achieving authenticity involves navigating the tension between freely choosing one's project and acknowledging the social and material restrictions that shape our possibilities. It requires a mature awareness of our limitations alongside a committed engagement with our chosen paths.

In conclusion, the human self is fundamentally interconnected, shaped by a web of relationships, social forces, and intersubjective experiences. Yet, within this interconnectedness lies a profound capacity for agency, the ability to make choices, take responsibility for our lives, and strive towards self-determination. This agency is not absolute but is constantly negotiated within the context of our relationships and the world around us. Understanding the dynamic interplay between the interconnected self and agency is not merely an academic exercise; it is essential for navigating the complexities of human existence, fostering meaningful connections, and striving towards an authentic and fulfilling life. Our agency finds its richest expression not in isolation but in the responsible and ethical engagement with the interconnected web of being that constitutes our shared human experience.
