Hannah Arendt is a German-Jewish political philosopher, known for her work on totalitarianism and her thesis that evil is ultimately banal. She developed this concept most notably when reporting on the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem in 1961. Eichmann was a lieutenant colonel in the SS responsible for managing the logistics of the Nazi concentration camps and the murder of millions.

What struck Arendt during the trial was that Eichmann was not the monstrous, wicked villain one might expect to find behind such horrific deeds. Instead, she described him as ordinary, commonplace, and even certified as normal by psychologists. His personal distinction, she observed, was perhaps an "extraordinary shallowness". He seemed to lack any particular wickedness, pathology, or strong ideological conviction; his only personal distinction might have been an "extraordinary diligence in looking out for his personal advancement".

Arendt's thesis of the "banality of evil" suggests that evil deeds on a gigantic scale can be committed by people who are not inherently monsters or demons. She linked this kind of evil not to deep-seated malice or wickedness, but rather to "indifference and self-deception". According to Arendt's analysis of Eichmann, the primary source of his evil was "sheer thoughtlessness", which she clearly distinguished from stupidity. This thoughtlessness manifested as a "curious, quite authentic inability to think" and a lack of imagination that prevented him from seeing things from the perspective of his victims.

Essentially, the "banality of evil" describes evil done by the "non-wicked everybody" who have no special motives and who simply live a "life of convention, simply living up to the code of conduct given to [them] by [their] society". People get "used to never making up their minds" and instead blindy follow orders or the law of the land, regardless of how evil those rules might be. Eichmann accepted the new code of judgment against him in court as if it were just another language rule, having previously accepted his monstrous duties as simply following the law and doing his duty. He "never realized what he was doing" in the sense that he didn't truly _think_ about the consequences or put himself in others' shoes.

This concept contrasts with traditional ideas of evil as something radical, deep, or demonic. While Arendt had previously used the term "radical evil" in _The Origins of Totalitarianism_ to describe totalitarianism's aim to destroy human spontaneity and make people superfluous, she later stated that evil is never "radical," but only "extreme," lacking depth or a demonic dimension. She suggested it spreads "like a fungus on the surface". It's "thought-defying" because it has no depth for thought to reach. The "sad truth" for Arendt is that "most evil is done by people who never made up their mind to be either good or bad". This suggests that becoming evil can be a gradual process, something one might not even realize is happening.

For Arendt, thinking is crucial as an antidote to this thoughtlessness. Thinking, in her view, involves an internal dialogue with oneself and an external dialogue involving seeing things from others' perspectives. This process allows individuals to reflect on whether they can "live with" their actions and to assess if they are harming others. Resisting evil, like those who opposed the Nazis, was about being able to live with oneself without shame, refusing to commit murder because they would not want to live with themselves as murderers. This highlights the connection between thought, the ability to engage with the perspectives of others (plurality), and the capacity for goodness.

The phrase "banality of evil" and Arendt's report were controversial. Some critics felt it trivialized the Holocaust and accused her of exonerating Eichmann or blaming the Jewish victims. Arendt clarified that she was describing a factual phenomenon she observed – the ordinariness of the man behind the monstrous deeds – not excusing him. She also rejected the idea that he was merely a "cog" in a machine, arguing that one must still ask why someone becomes and continues to function as a cog. While debates continue about the historical accuracy of Arendt's depiction of Eichmann himself, the _idea_ that ordinary people can commit horrendous evil for seemingly banal reasons remains relevant and challenges how we think about moral responsibility and the nature of evil. It forces us to consider the dangers of thoughtlessness, indifference, and the failure to critically engage with the world and the perspectives of others.
