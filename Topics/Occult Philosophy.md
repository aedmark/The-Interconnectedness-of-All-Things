Alright, let's delve into the concept of Occult Philosophy as it appears in the sources provided. We can explore its core ideas, structure, and historical context, touching upon related concepts that might offer paths for deeper thought.

Based on the sources, particularly the excerpts from "Three Books of Occult Philosophy" by Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, Occult Philosophy is presented as a collection of hidden sciences and arts, uniting various traditions such as chemistry, magic, and kabbalah. Agrippa aimed to restore the understanding of magic, viewing it as an ancient discipline revered by wise men, philosophers, and priests, which was later rejected by theologians and forbidden by laws. His goal was to purge impious errors from magic and vindicate its true tradition.

Occult Philosophy, according to Agrippa's work, is structured around a threefold manifestation of reality, divided into three books:

1. **Book One: The Natural World:** This part focuses on the natural world. It discusses concepts like the World Spirit and how it connects occult virtues. Agrippa suggests that everything in the natural world is imbued with "divine assistance" or "divine virtues," which ancient thinkers like Democritus, Orpheus, and Pythagoreans called "gods," or others called "living things" or "souls". The qualities of things are said to depend on these virtues. This book might also touch upon the power of numbers and their connection to letters for divination or finding hidden mysteries.
2. **Book Two: The Celestial World:** This book moves to the celestial realm, discussing the mysteries of celestial magic. It involves understanding how superior entities influence inferior ones, suggesting that humans can connect to higher spirits. Success in this realm is linked to faith in the "First Author" and diligent prayer to enlighten the mind.
3. **Book Three: The Divine World:** This final part addresses the intellectual or divine world. It discusses the importance of religion, purity, secrecy, and theology, including the nature of God, the Holy Trinity, and the names of God and pagan gods. It also explores the hierarchy and nature of celestial spirits, intelligences, daemons, and personal geniuses. This book delves into concepts like the language of angels, ways to discover spirits, attracting good daemons, and expelling evil ones. It also touches upon the nature of humans, the human soul, and the influence of divine forces, as well as concepts like death and necromancy. The power of sacred words and divine names is also a key element, drawing on testaments from philosophers like Zoroaster, Orpheus, and Iamblichus.

A fundamental aspect of practicing these "magical arts" within Occult Philosophy is secrecy. The gods are said to detest public things and love secrets, meaning magical experiments should be kept concealed. They are strengthened by silence and harmed if made visible or discussed with unbelieving minds. Purity and a sacred disposition are also necessary for receiving oracles. Expiation of the mind can be achieved through external traditions and sacraments like sacrifices, baptisms, exorcisms, blessings, consecrations, purifications, anointings, and suffumigations.

Occult Philosophy, as presented, connects to several other philosophical and religious traditions mentioned in the sources. Agrippa explicitly links it to Kabbalah, noting similarities in terminology and concepts, such as Orpheus's "Night" being similar to Kabbalah's Ein Soph. The sources also mention connections to Orphism and Pythagoreanism, which studied celestial virtues and believed everything is full of gods. Orphism, in particular, is noted for its belief in transmigration of souls, purification ceremonies, and the idea of becoming one with Bacchus. Pythagoras was seen as a reformer of Orphism, and Orphic elements entered into Plato's philosophy and subsequently influenced later religious philosophy.

Neoplatonism is also linked, with sources noting its influence on Christian theology, particularly through figures like Augustine and Aquinas. Neoplatonic ideas are said to be manifested in thinkers who identified the Neoplatonic One with God, approached God through reason, or held speculative mystical views. Dionysian writings are described as molding Neoplatonic language to express Christian insights, turning the idea of a scale of being into a structure of theophany. Plotinus, a major Neoplatonist, is mentioned in contrast with the positive evil resulting from sin, upheld against determinists. Ockham's razor is presented as cutting away elements of Neoplatonism, such as the World Soul, Great Chain of Being, and divine emanations, if not supported by observation or faith. Agrippa himself discusses the World Soul and its relationship with celestials in his work.

Gnosticism is another related tradition that appears in the sources. Gnostic texts describe an incorruptible realm, the spirit of wisdom (Sophia), and the creation of a lower realm of darkness and chaos ruled by an inferior principle. Gnosticism is characterized by a dualism between the divine and the material world, where the true God is transmundane and the world is the creation of a lower principle. Paul is described as adopting a Gnostic distinction between "pneumatic man" and "psychic man". Hermetic philosophy, which is mentioned alongside Gnosticism, also features the idea of the coniunctio, a union of male and female, often used as a technical term.

In contrast to Occult Philosophy's emphasis on hidden arts, spiritual connections, and mystical knowledge, the sources also touch upon other philosophical approaches. Modern science is described as requiring empirical evidence and quantifiable measurements to understand reality. Descartes, marking a "Cartesian moment," is presented as initiating a shift away from ancient spiritual exercises towards seeking certain knowledge through systematic doubt of the senses, leading to a focus on reason and scientific knowledge. This shift is seen as moving philosophy away from spiritual transformation of the subject towards critique and understanding limits. Traditional Western philosophy after the split with Orthodoxy is sometimes characterized by a greater emphasis on discursive reasoning compared to the experiential and mystical approach favored in Orthodox theology.

So, Occult Philosophy, as suggested by these sources, is not just a collection of practices but a historical tradition that views reality through multiple interconnected levels (natural, celestial, divine) and seeks hidden knowledge and virtues through specific methods, often involving secrecy, purity, and connection to spiritual forces. It stands in contrast to modern scientific and some post-Cartesian philosophical approaches that prioritize empirical evidence, rational analysis, and quantifiable reality. It's a fascinating area that touches upon diverse historical currents in thought, from ancient mysticism to Renaissance esotericism.
