Embarking on a discussion about public reasoning and justice theory reform is like peeling back layers of a truly complex and profound onion. It reveals how our understanding of fairness and societal organization has evolved, pushing us to constantly re-evaluate how we make collective decisions and address the glaring injustices around us. Both John Rawls and Amartya Sen have profoundly shaped this landscape, each in their own distinctive way, guiding us toward a more reflective and engaged approach to justice.

Let's delve into their perspectives and the fascinating reforms they propose.

### John Rawls: Crafting Justice from a Shared Rationality

John Rawls's seminal work, "A Theory of Justice," fundamentally reshaped political philosophy by offering a systematic alternative to utilitarianism, drawing heavily on the social contract tradition of Locke, Rousseau, and Kant. His initial aim was to work out a theory of justice that would be a viable alternative to doctrines that had long dominated philosophical thought.

**Justice as Fairness and the Original Position:** Rawls introduces "justice as fairness," a theory that generalizes and elevates the traditional social contract concept to a higher level of abstraction. The core idea is that principles of justice for society's basic structure are the outcome of an "original agreement". This agreement is made by "free and rational persons concerned to further their own interests" in an "initial position of equality". This hypothetical situation, known as the "original position," is designed to ensure that the fundamental agreements reached are fair, hence the name "justice as fairness".

Crucially, in the original position, individuals choose principles behind a "veil of ignorance," which prevents them from knowing their own abilities, intelligence, social standing, wealth, or even their particular conception of the good. This ensures impartiality, forcing parties to consider society from a perspective that benefits all members, regardless of their eventual position. The principles chosen are meant to regulate all further agreements and specify the forms of social cooperation and government.

**The Role of Publicity and Reflective Equilibrium:** Rawls emphasizes the "publicity condition" for principles of justice, meaning that if these principles are the outcome of an agreement, citizens must have knowledge of the principles that others follow. A well-ordered society, as Rawls defines it, is one where everyone accepts and knows that others accept the same principles of justice, and its basic institutions are known to satisfy these principles. This public recognition fosters trust and confidence, extending the scope of mutually advantageous cooperation.

The justification for a conception of justice, for Rawls, is achieved through "reflective equilibrium". This process involves a back-and-forth adjustment between our "considered judgments" about specific cases and general moral principles, aiming for a coherent view where everything fits together. It's not about imposing external truths but about achieving internal coherence and bringing our judgments into line through reflection and discussion.

**From "A Theory of Justice" to "Political Liberalism": A Crucial Reform:** The shift in Rawls's thinking from "A Theory of Justice" (TJ) to "Political Liberalism" (PL) represents a significant reform in his justice theory. In TJ, justice as fairness was presented as a "comprehensive liberal doctrine" where all members of a well-ordered society would affirm the same doctrine. However, Rawls later recognized this as "unrealistic" given the "fact of reasonable pluralism" – the enduring presence of diverse, often conflicting, yet reasonable religious, philosophical, and moral doctrines in democratic societies.

This realization led him to recast justice as fairness as a "political conception of justice". This political conception is _freestanding_, meaning it is not derived from, nor does it presuppose, any particular comprehensive doctrine. Instead, its content is drawn from fundamental ideas "implicit in the public political culture of a democratic society". The aim is to find a "public basis of justification on fundamental political questions" that can be shared by citizens despite their deep differences.

**Public Reason in Political Liberalism:** In PL, "public reason" becomes central to how citizens, as a collective body, exercise political power. It applies primarily to "constitutional essentials" and "matters of basic justice," such as voting rights, religious toleration, and fair equality of opportunity. The content of public reason is given by a "family of reasonable political conceptions of justice" (not just justice as fairness). This content includes substantive principles of justice (equal basic liberties, fair equality of opportunity, the difference principle) and guidelines of inquiry (publicly recognized ways of reasoning and criteria for evidence, rooted in common sense and established science).

Citizens have a "duty of civility" to abide by public reason, meaning they should be ready to explain the basis of their actions to one another in terms that others could reasonably endorse, consistent with their freedom and equality. Rawls introduces the "proviso": citizens may introduce their comprehensive doctrines into public political discussion, _provided that_ they also offer "proper political reasons" to support their proposals in due course. This "inclusive view" of public reason aims to strengthen the ideal of public reason by allowing for a richer public discourse.

The stability of a just society, under reasonable pluralism, is achieved through an "overlapping consensus". This means that reasonable comprehensive doctrines, each from its own perspective, endorse the political conception of justice. They don't abandon their deeper views, but find the political conception compatible with or even supported by them. This ensures stability "for the right reasons," not just as a mere _modus vivendi_ (a temporary compromise based on self-interest).

### Amartya Sen: Real-World Injustice and Open Impartiality

Amartya Sen, while acknowledging his immense debt to Rawls for reviving philosophical interest in justice, proposes a different path in "The Idea of Justice." He argues for a reform in justice theory by moving away from what he calls "transcendental institutionalism" – the focus on identifying perfectly just institutions. Sen believes this approach, exemplified by many social contract theories, including Rawls's early work, is neither necessary nor sufficient for addressing actual injustices.

**From Perfect Justice to Reducing Injustice:** Sen's "realization-focused comparison" shifts the theoretical lens towards understanding and reducing observable injustices. He argues that we don't need a complete theory of "perfect justice" to identify and act against manifest injustices like slavery, medical neglect, torture, or chronic hunger. The impetus for thinking about justice often comes from our recognition of injustice, and moving from a tragedy to a diagnosis of injustice inherently involves reasoning about preventable actions and accountability.

**Public Reasoning and Democracy as "Government by Discussion":** For Sen, public reasoning is paramount not only for diagnosing injustice but also for democratic practice itself. He sees democracy as "government by discussion," an idea championed by John Stuart Mill and further developed by Rawls and Habermas. Public reasoning in this context involves enhancing informational availability and fostering interactive discussions, allowing diverse voices to be heard. This process is central to objective ethical and political beliefs, relating to their ability to withstand open public scrutiny and critical evaluation.

**Open Impartiality and Avoiding Parochialism:** A key reform proposed by Sen is the move from "closed impartiality" to "open impartiality". Rawls's original position, while ensuring impartiality _among citizens of a given society_, is an example of closed impartiality, as "no outsider is involved in, or a party to, such a contractarian procedure". This, Sen argues, risks parochialism, where local values, preconceptions, and biases might not be sufficiently scrutinized.

Sen draws on Adam Smith's concept of the "impartial spectator" to advocate for "open impartiality". This approach requires considering the perspectives and reasonings of anyone whose assessments are relevant, not just those within a particular group or nation. These "distant voices" offer "enlightenment relevance," helping to broaden our understanding and avoid being trapped by local views, especially crucial in an interdependent global context.

**The Capability Approach as an Informational Focus:** Sen also reforms how we assess individual advantage and societal well-being. Instead of focusing solely on "utility" (happiness or pleasure) or "resources" (income, wealth), he advocates for the "capability approach". This approach emphasizes the actual freedoms and opportunities people have to achieve the kind of life they value, and their ability to convert resources into actual functionings. Understanding "capability deprivation" is central to identifying and removing manifest injustices, and this approach foregrounds social realizations over mere institutional arrangements.

### Comparing Their Contributions to Justice Theory Reform

Both Rawls and Sen are giants in contemporary political philosophy, and their work, while distinct, offers powerful, often complementary, reforms to our understanding of justice and the role of public reasoning.

**Shared Ground:**

- **Emphasis on Public Reasoning:** Both thinkers underscore that justice is not a private affair but requires public discourse, deliberation, and justification. They see it as a collective, reasoned process, not solely based on intuition or sentiment.
- **Reasonableness and Rationality:** Both distinguish between "rationality" (pursuing one's interests effectively) and "reasonableness" (being willing to propose and abide by fair terms of cooperation). This distinction is crucial for understanding how individuals can cooperate fairly.
- **Practical Relevance of Philosophy:** Both view political philosophy as having a crucial role in addressing real-world problems and guiding social action. For Rawls, ideal theory provides a guiding aim for reform; for Sen, the direct focus is on identifying and removing manifest injustices.

**Key Differences and Reforms:**

1. **Scope of Impartiality:** This is perhaps the most significant divergence.
    
    - **Rawls (Closed Impartiality):** Primarily concerned with justice _within_ a society, where citizens deliberate under the veil of ignorance, but outsiders are not explicitly part of the initial contract. While he later addresses "the law of peoples" internationally, it's a separate "original position" between representatives of polities, not an open-ended global deliberation.
    - **Sen (Open Impartiality):** Advocates for drawing on "distant voices" and global perspectives to avoid "parochialism" in assessing justice. He believes this "enlightenment relevance" is essential, especially in an interconnected world, for a truly objective and comprehensive understanding of justice.
2. **Focus of Justice Theory:**
    
    - **Rawls (Transcendental Institutionalism):** His primary project, especially in TJ, is to define the principles of a "perfectly just" basic structure of society under ideal conditions ("strict compliance" theory). Non-ideal theory (dealing with injustice) is to be worked out _after_ the ideal conception is chosen.
    - **Sen (Realization-Focused Comparison):** Argues that identifying perfect justice is often unnecessary and sometimes impossible for the practical task of "enhancing justice and removing injustice". His approach concentrates on comparing different social "realizations" to see which one is "less unjust".
3. **Completeness and Indeterminacy:**
    
    - **Rawls:** Aims for a relatively definite and complete set of principles to guide institutional design. While he acknowledges indeterminacy in applying principles to specific policies, his underlying framework strives for a clear resolution in principle.
    - **Sen:** Embraces "incompleteness" as an inherent part of justice assessment, stemming from factors like information gaps or irresolvable conflicts between different equity considerations. Partial orderings, rather than complete ones, are often sufficient and more realistic for practical action.
4. **Behavioral Assumptions:**
    
    - **Rawls:** In his ideal theory, he assumes "strict compliance," meaning everyone acts justly and upholds just institutions. He outlines how a "sense of justice" would be acquired in a well-ordered society, which would then lead to congruence between individual good and justice.
    - **Sen:** Critiques Rawls for making the analysis of justice too dependent on "ideal" individual behavior. He stresses the interdependent roles of institutions and _actual_ behavioral patterns, recognizing that people may not always behave "reasonably," even after a political conception is accepted.
5. **Nature of Normativity:**
    
    - **Rawls:** Moves from "truth" (implicit in TJ's comprehensive doctrine) to "reasonableness" for political conceptions in PL. This allows for an overlapping consensus by being "political, not metaphysical".
    - **Sen:** While using Rawls's distinction between rational and reasonable, Sen often relies on broader traditions of reasoned argument, including non-Western sources, and acknowledges that emotions can initiate the process of identifying injustice before reasoning refines it.

### Further Ideas and Questions to Explore

The rich interplay between these thinkers opens up many avenues for deeper exploration:

- **Integrating Open and Closed Impartiality:** How might Sen's "open impartiality," which draws on diverse global perspectives, be systematically integrated into Rawls's more structured framework of public reason? Could a "global original position" (which Rawls himself explored in "The Law of Peoples" but Sen found insufficient for its transcendentalism and focus on states rather than individuals) be re-envisioned through Sen's realization-focused approach?
- **The Role of Emotion and Outrage:** Sen highlights how "inflamed minds" and a "sense of injustice" can be a prelude to critical scrutiny and motivate reasoning. How can justice theories explicitly account for the role of emotion in activating moral concern and public discourse, without letting it overshadow rational deliberation?
- **Addressing Persistent Indeterminacy:** If both thinkers acknowledge that full agreement or perfect justice might be elusive, what practical strategies can societies employ to navigate the "indeterminacy" that remains in areas of social and economic policy, where multiple "reasonable" outcomes might exist?
- **Public Reasoning in a Digital Age:** Given the rise of social media and global communication, how do these platforms enhance or hinder the kind of "public reasoning" envisioned by Rawls and Sen? Do they facilitate "open impartiality" by amplifying diverse voices, or do they risk exacerbating "unreasonable pluralism" and fragmenting public discourse?
- **Beyond Liberalism:** While Rawls's later work embraces "political liberalism," allowing for support from diverse comprehensive doctrines, Sen's broader comparative approach suggests that insights into justice can come from an even wider array of philosophical traditions, including those not rooted in liberal thought. How might this further diversify the sources and methods of justice theory?
- **The Problem of Compliance and "Less Than Favorable Conditions":** Rawls explicitly limits his ideal theory to "strict compliance" under "favorable conditions," leaving "nonideal theory" for later. Sen, by focusing on "reducing injustice," inherently engages with less than ideal conditions and the complexities of actual behavior. How can these two approaches better inform each other to create a theory that is both aspirational and robustly applicable to a deeply imperfect world?
- **Critiques of the "Reasonable":** Rawls's frequent use of "reasonable persons" and "reasonable comprehensive doctrines" has drawn scrutiny, with some arguing it contains normative assumptions that might implicitly exclude certain views. How robust is the concept of "reasonableness" when faced with deeply held, but politically "unreasonable," convictions?

The ongoing dialogue between Rawlsian and Senian perspectives is crucial for the continuous reform of justice theory, pushing us to constantly refine our understanding of what justice demands, not just in ideal terms, but in the messy reality of human societies.
