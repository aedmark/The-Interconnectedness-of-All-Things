Wakefulness, often described as a higher state of consciousness or an awakened state of being, encompasses a range of profound perceptual, affective, conceptual, and behavioral characteristics that set it apart from ordinary states of mind.

### Defining Wakefulness

Eckhart Tolle and Stephen Taylor define wakefulness as a new dimension of consciousness, awareness, or presence, fundamentally characterized by "disidentification from thinking". It signifies rising _above_ thought rather than falling below it, allowing one to use the mind as a tool without being enslaved by it. This state involves realizing the "being behind the human," a deeper identity as "unconditioned consciousness itself". Gadamer suggests "vigilance" (Wachsamkeit) or "alertness" (Wachheit) as alternative terms, emphasizing a consciousness that is aware of its own limits and the workings of history. For the Dalai Lama, wakefulness, or "the mental," is defined by two features: luminosity (clarity to reveal) and knowing (faculty to perceive).

This state contrasts sharply with what Tolle refers to as "unconsciousness," which is an identification with the mind, creating a false self or ego. It also differs from literal sleep states, where normal bodily functions may operate, but the "you" as a conscious entity is largely absent, especially in deep, dreamless sleep, where one merges with the Source but without conscious awareness or memory. While neurologists sometimes define consciousness simply as a waking, alert state, a deeper understanding of wakefulness goes beyond mere reactivity, involving a profound internal shift.

### Core Characteristics of Wakefulness

Wakefulness transforms an individual's vision of and relationship to the world, their subjective experience, sense of identity, and conceptual outlook. These characteristics are often uniform across awakened individuals, varying primarily in overall intensity.

1. **Perceptual Characteristics: A New World**
    
    - **Intensified Perception:** Awakened individuals experience the world with vivid, direct, and non-automatic perception, akin to that of a child. Phenomena, even mundane ones, appear with wonder, beauty, and intricacy. Nature, in particular, is captivating in its "is-ness" and beauty. This heightened awareness stems from the ego consuming less energy, allowing perception to remain fresh and intense.
    - **Aliveness, Harmony, and Connectedness:** To the awakened person, there are no inanimate objects; everything, from stones to furniture, shines with "radiant aliveness of spirit". This leads to a strong sense of connection and harmony with the world and all its forms, reflecting a "direct apprehension of the essential sameness of our being with the being of everything else". This aligns with the Vedantic idea of the oneness of one's _atman_ with the all-pervading _brahman_.
    - **Transcendence of Duality:** Wakefulness uncovers the illusion of _maya_ (deception), revealing a world of unity behind apparent diversity, where subject-object duality fades away.
2. **Affective/Emotional Characteristics: Inner Well-Being**
    
    - **Inner Quietness/Stillness:** A significant feature is the dramatic reduction of constant "thought-chatter" â€“ the endless stream of images, memories, and anticipations that normally runs through the mind. The mind becomes peaceful and calm, "like a lake," freeing itself from involuntary internal dialogue.
    - **Profound Well-Being and Bliss:** Awakened individuals generally experience a state of intense well-being, characterized by serenity, contentment, and often bliss. They are liberated from the psychological discord of everyday life, such as habitual worry, negative emotions, boredom, loneliness, and dissatisfaction.
    - **Appreciation and Gratitude:** There is a heightened sense of gratitude for all aspects of life, from health and freedom to simple experiences, counteracting the "taking for granted syndrome" of the sleep state.
    - **Absence of Fear of Death:** Fear, particularly the fear of death, significantly decreases. This is attributed to a reduced sense of separateness, which typically makes individuals feel vulnerable and threatened by the world.
3. **Conceptual/Cognitive Characteristics: A New Mind**
    
    - **Increased Presentness/Timelessness:** Awakened individuals become intensely present, with the past and future losing much of their importance. They focus on immediate experience, transcending the linear flow of time.
    - **Broadened Perspective/Universal Outlook:** The egocentric outlook of ordinary consciousness shifts to a wider, global, and universal perspective. Distinctions like religion, ethnicity, or nationality are seen as superficial, and there's a strong sense of oneness and empathy with all human beings.
    - **Autonomy and Authenticity:** Awakened individuals become more inner-directed and autonomous, less swayed by cultural values or public opinion. They live according to their inner sense of rightness, with greater confidence in their choices.
    - **Transcendence of Ego:** The "self-system" of ordinary consciousness, with its strong boundaries and energy-consuming ego, dissolves or softens. This is often described not as a disappearance of the self, but as an "expansion of self," where identity extends beyond the personal body and mind to encompass wider realities, ultimately the cosmos.
    - **Beyond Intellectual Grasp:** The true meaning of awakening cannot be fully understood conceptually but requires direct experience, with concepts serving as pointers rather than ultimate explanations.
4. **Behavioral Characteristics: A New Life**
    
    - **Altruism and Service:** There's a strong impulse to contribute positively to the world, often manifesting as a high degree of compassion, altruism, and self-sacrifice. The well-being of others becomes as important as, or even more important than, one's own.
    - **Reduced Materialism/Status-Seeking:** Awakened individuals have less concern for worldly success, possessions, or personal ambition, and are unaffected by external praise or blame. They feel whole and have no need to accumulate things to mitigate a sense of incompleteness.

### Degrees and Development of Wakefulness

Wakefulness is not a static or binary state; rather, it exists on a continuum with varying degrees of intensity and different ways of unfolding. It can manifest as temporary "awakening experiences" or as a stable, "permanent wakefulness". Some individuals may be naturally born awake ("evolutionary throw-forwards"), displaying characteristics of wakefulness from childhood. Others achieve it gradually through spiritual practices like meditation, or suddenly following intense psychological turmoil, such as crisis or trauma. Even once integrated, wakefulness is a continuous process of development, not an endpoint.

### Challenges and Misconceptions

Despite its positive aspects, the process of awakening can be confusing and disorienting, especially in its initial stages. A lack of a conceptual framework can lead to difficulties or even the suppression of the state. Some characteristics of wakefulness, such as an altered sense of time, can superficially resemble aspects of psychosis, although most core features like empathy and mental quietness do not occur in psychosis. Additionally, pre-existing negative personality traits may carry over into the awakened state, potentially becoming amplified, especially for spiritual teachers. There are also common misconceptions, such as the idea that wakefulness makes one incapable of behaving improperly or that the world literally becomes an illusion.

Ultimately, wakefulness represents a profound psychological and ontological transformation, a return to what some traditions consider our deepest nature, marked by an expanded awareness, inner tranquility, and a compassionate engagement with the world.
