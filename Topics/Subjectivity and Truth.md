One prominent thread in Western philosophy, particularly since René Descartes, has centered on the idea of the individual subject as the starting point for knowledge and truth. Descartes' famous assertion, "I think, therefore I am," posits the certainty of one's own consciousness as the absolute truth from which all other knowledge might be built. This approach grounds truth in an activity of the "I," an act of judgment or recognition on the part of subjectivity. The subjective ego becomes the guarantor of truth. This individualistic and subjective tendency, though not always prominent, has remained a significant strain in modern philosophy, seen in various forms from Descartes through philosophers like Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, and Russell.

However, basing truth solely on individual subjectivity faces challenges. If truth is merely "what I believe" or "true for me," it risks collapsing into pure relativism or solipsism, where reality becomes indistinguishable from perception, and evidence is cherry-picked to support a personal ideology. This perspective can be seen as a potential pitfall, especially if it prevents dialogue across different viewpoints.

Many philosophical traditions have sought to navigate the relationship between subjectivity and truth without falling into radical relativism. Phenomenology, for instance, proposes focusing on the world as we know it through our immediate experience. It suggests that our primary engagement with the world is as embodied and situated agents with our own interests, which forms the heart of subjectivity. However, this subjectivity is often framed not as solipsism, but as **intersubjectivity**, recognizing shared experiences and structures among human beings.

Hermeneutics, the science of interpretation, is closely linked to these approaches. It emphasizes that understanding, including the understanding of texts or even being itself, is fundamentally an act of interpretation. Within psychological research, for example, subjectivity is constantly present, and rather than concealing it, an approach called "disciplined subjectivity" is seen as potentially constructive for understanding, acknowledging the researcher's involvement. For philosophers like Gadamer, hermeneutics involves understanding the "objectifications of life". Philosophical hermeneutics is concerned with meaning-making processes and interpretation, aiming to grasp the meaning of everyday practices and beliefs. It doesn't necessarily strive for **absolute truth**; instead, it insists on human finitude and sees limits not just as boundaries, but as horizons opening up new possibilities for understanding.

Existentialism, influenced by figures like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, also takes subjective human experience as its point of departure. Kierkegaard emphasized the subjective relation to the truth we seek. For him, the individual is "in the truth" if their _mode_ of relationship is truthful, even if they are relating to something factually untrue. This revolutionary idea highlights the importance of the individual's inner stance and experience in relation to truth. While acknowledging this subjective starting point, some existential approaches recognize that individual choices and authenticity gain meaning and validation within a social context or a "horizon of significance," suggesting that intersubjectivity is crucial and that one's choices are informed and made meaningful by this context. This perspective aims to overcome criticisms of being purely subjectively derived.

The concept of truth itself is approached from multiple angles. Traditionally, philosophy often sought knowledge of universal truth. Some views see truth as an objective quality, something everyone ought to accept, regardless of individual bias. This contrasts sharply with relativistic views.

Pragmatism offers a different take. Charles Sanders Peirce, a key figure in pragmatism, defined truth as "The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate". This links truth to the outcome of collective inquiry rather than immediate subjective certainty. However, other interpretations of pragmatism, influenced by William James, emphasize pluralism and the idea that reality is multiple, unfinished, and chaotic, leading to a view of truth as a "contingent conquest" created by human invention rather than a passive reflection of a pre-given order. Rorty, another figure associated with pragmatism, even suggests that the pragmatist insight is not a new theory of truth, but the realization that truth is "uninteresting" as a philosophical concept, proposing "interesting" or "remarkable" as superior values for determining success. This view questions the traditional preoccupation with truth as the primary aim of philosophy.

Michel Foucault presents a particularly influential perspective that questions the idea of universal, timeless truth. He suggests that truth is not a single thing, but that there are "different truths and different ways of saying it". Foucault analyzes "regimes of truth," arguing that what is considered true and how truth is established are historically contingent and deeply entwined with power relations. He uses methods like "archaeology" and "genealogy" to uncover the historical circumstances that lead to thinking something is true, rather than seeking absolute truth itself. For Foucault, the process of truth-telling (parrhesia) is linked to the constitution and transformation of the subject. Access to truth, in his view, is not simply a matter of objective knowledge gained by method and evidence, but may require the subject to undergo transformation or "ascesis". This contrasts with the modern philosophical tendency, which Foucault argues emerged forcefully after Descartes ("the Cartesian moment"), to see knowledge and method alone as providing access to truth, without requiring a transformation of one's being. Foucault challenges the authority granted to scientific truth as the most authoritative form of knowledge, viewing it as one among many possible "regimes of truth," including religious, artistic, psychoanalytic, or moral ones, each requiring the constitution of different subjectivities. His work is seen as a critical project aiming at the transformation of the subject through philosophy.

Other philosophical traditions also highlight the interplay of perspectives. Indian philosophy, for instance, developed a method of philosophical discussion that required first stating the opponent's "prior view" (pūrvapakṣa) before offering one's own "subsequent view" or conclusion (siddhānta) after refuting the opponent. This structured approach acknowledges different viewpoints as part of the search for truth.

The Scottish philosophy, in contrast to some continental European trends, stressed observation and experience as primary sources of knowledge, viewing human consciousness as the window onto reality and the self, and emphasizing an innate capacity to grasp truth.

Ultimately, the relationship between subjectivity and truth remains a dynamic and contested area. Some philosophies emphasize the objective nature of truth, existing independently of individual thought, while others see truth as fundamentally tied to subjective experience, interpretation, or intersubjective agreement. Philosophers like Foucault challenge the very notion of a single, universal truth, suggesting instead multiple, historically contingent "regimes of truth" linked to power and the subject's constitution. The recognition of pluralism—the existence of multiple valid perspectives or ways of understanding—is a recurring theme in many contemporary discussions about truth and subjectivity. This diversity of thought underscores that there is no single, universally accepted method for defining or attaining truth, and that the role of the subjective, knowing individual in this process is a central point of philosophical debate.
