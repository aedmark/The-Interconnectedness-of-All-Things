The phenomenological method, primarily associated with Edmund Husserl, is a philosophical approach aimed at understanding the world as it appears to consciousness, focusing on lived experience and the structures of consciousness that make this experience possible. The term "phenomenology," coined by Husserl, derives from "phenomenon," meaning "appearances" or "perceptions". The central goal is to describe what it is like to be conscious or to have a given experience, seeking the "definitions of essences" or general descriptions of categories of experience rather than specific events. Husserl conceived phenomenology as a rigorous science interested in discovering the specific processes of mental synthesis and the concepts by which they are apprehended.

One of the foundational principles of Husserl's phenomenology is the maxim "Back to the things themselves!". This principle emphasizes the need to directly examine phenomena as they present themselves to consciousness, without the interference of preconceived theories or assumptions. Husserl believed that ready-made theories could conceal the self-givenness of a phenomenon.

The phenomenological method involves several key steps and attitudes:

1. **The Epoché (or Phenomenological Reduction):** This is a crucial first step that involves a radical change in attitude, a "reduction of the 'natural attitude'". The natural attitude is the "general positing of existence" that presumes a real world determining what is experienced. The epoché entails "bracketing" or suspending judgment about the existence of the external world and the truth of our everyday beliefs about it. As Sartre explains, this is a "'step back' from belief concerning what exists in nature... In 'stepping backward' one does not contest any factual belief... Rather, one 'steps back', as it were, from the 'natural viewpoint' of factual belief". Phenomenology, in this sense, becomes agnostic about the nature of reality, focusing instead on the individual's subjective, lived experience. The aim of the epoché is the reduction of the natural attitude, allowing for the exploration of pure consciousness or the appearance of the world to consciousness.

2. **The Phenomenological Reduction (further elaboration):** Following the epoché, the phenomenologist engages in phenomenological reduction, which leads "from an unreflected immersion in the world back to the understanding of how certain appearances and givens in experience are related to certain structures of the subjectivity that allow certain phenomena to appear to us in cognition". This involves examining the correlation between the object of experience and the act of experiencing it. The focus shifts from what is experienced to how it is experienced and the essential structures of consciousness involved in that experience.

3. **Eidetic Variation:** While not always explicitly listed as a primary step in every source, mentions "eidetic variations" as part of the essence of the phenomenological method. This involves imaginatively varying the features of a phenomenon to discern its essential structure or eidos – what makes it the kind of phenomenon it is. By systematically altering aspects of an experience in thought, the phenomenologist aims to identify the invariant features without which the experience would no longer be of that particular kind.

4. **Intersubjective Justification:** Source also includes "intersubjective justification" as a step in the phenomenological method. This implies that while phenomenology begins with subjective experience, its findings should be capable of intersubjective validation or understanding within a community of experiencing subjects. Husserl extended the concept of phenomenological experience beyond the individual to the "intersubjective context," leading to the idea of "community psychic life in its phenomenological purity".


The phenomenological attitude is crucial for this method. It requires a constant reflection on the presuppositions of the natural attitude and a sustained effort to suspend them through the epoché. This attitude is distinct from both "naïve everyday consciousness" and the "realism of positivist scientism," which assumes a reality independent of us and knowable through objective methods without reflecting on its own foundations. The phenomenological attitude, as Scheler describes it, is "the most intensely vital and most immediate contact with the world itself... and with these things as they are immediately given in experience, that is in the act of experience". Reinach defines this attitude as "essence analysis," separating out what should not be confused with the subject of investigation, which is different from everyday viewing and scientific verification.

Intentionality is a central concept in phenomenology, stating that "all consciousness is consciousness of something". Consciousness is always directed toward an object in the world, be it real or imagined. This "intentional act" and its "intended object" are fundamental to the structure of consciousness as understood in phenomenology.

It is important to distinguish phenomenology from introspection. While both deal with inner experience, phenomenology is not merely concerned with what goes on inside one's head but with exploring "the contribution of the cognizing subject to cognition that ordinary consciousness ignores". Phenomenology aims to describe the structures of consciousness that shape our experience of the world, not just report on subjective feelings or thoughts in isolation.

Husserl himself distinguished between **philosophical phenomenology** and **psychological phenomenology**. Psychological phenomenology, being closer to our natural thinking, can serve as an introduction to the former. According to Husserl, phenomenological psychology concentrates on psychic experience as it becomes conscious, studying "intentional, phenomenological experiences" free from psychophysical considerations.

However, phenomenology is not a monolithic method, and different thinkers have interpreted and applied it in various ways. Heidegger, Husserl's student, viewed phenomenology as "the science of discovering phenomena, which means to let that which shows itself be seen from itself in the very way in which it shows itself from itself". He agreed with the maxim "To the things themselves!" but emphasized that phenomena have to be illuminated, as their essential properties are often hidden. Scheler interpreted phenomenology not just as a method but as an attitude of immediate engagement with the world as it is given in experience, involving a "continual desymbolization of the world". Reinach defined it as "essence analysis," requiring a suspension of the natural attitude to grasp the essential structures of what is being investigated.

Later developments in phenomenology include **genetic phenomenology**, where Husserl explored the genesis or development of consciousness and how phenomena emerge over time. He considered this approach "explanatory" as it reveals how something has become what it is. Furthermore, a move towards **historical phenomenology** examines the historical and cultural contexts that shape our experience of the world.

Phenomenology has had a significant influence across various disciplines. In psychology, it forms the basis of phenomenological psychiatry and has strongly influenced existential psychology and humanistic psychology. It has also impacted sociology, literary criticism, and theology. The rise of hermeneutics, the theory of interpretation, is closely linked to phenomenology, with figures like Dilthey initially using "descriptive psychology" (an early form of phenomenology) before replacing it with hermeneutics. Heidegger further developed this relationship, aiming to "de-psychologize hermeneutics" and view interpretation as a fundamental mode of being. Gadamer built upon this with his philosophical hermeneutics, emphasizing the "forestructure" of understanding and the priority of ontology over epistemology.

Despite its emphasis on subjective experience, phenomenology is not a return to purely introspective psychology. It differs significantly from empiricism and traditional scientific methods that treat consciousness as an object to be predicted and controlled. Phenomenology deliberately aims to be autonomous, independent of the natural and social sciences, relying instead on a philosophical, internal analysis of consciousness and experience.

However, the phenomenological method has also faced critiques and has been modified over time. Some have questioned the possibility of a truly presuppositionless starting point and the nature of the reduction. The relationship between phenomenology and language has also been a topic of discussion, with some arguing that all showing is mediated by language, complicating the idea of immediate access to phenomena. Despite these discussions and developments, the core of the phenomenological method remains the rigorous and systematic exploration of consciousness and lived experience to uncover the essential structures that shape our understanding of the world.
