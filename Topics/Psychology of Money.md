This idea suggests that our relationship with money is much more deeply influenced by psychological factors, including emotions, biases, and personal experiences, than by purely technical or mathematical principles.

Often, finance and dealing with money are taught as fields based on formulas and data, much like physics with its rules and laws. However, this perspective, while potentially offering mathematically optimal strategies, can overlook the very human elements at play. The psychology of money, in contrast, emphasizes the emotional and nuanced aspects of financial decisions and behaviors. It recognizes that people do things with money that might seem "crazy" from a purely rational standpoint, but which have valid, often deeply personal, reasons behind them.

One core aspect of the psychology of money is understanding what drives our desire for it. Money is sometimes described as "frozen desire" because it has the versatile ability to transform into whatever we want. It's not desired for its own sake, but for what it can purchase, which in turn often corresponds to broader longings like comfort. However, the pursuit of money can sometimes become an end in itself, not just a means to satisfy needs. Figures like the miser, who finds pleasure solely in accumulating money, and the spendthrift, who finds pleasure in the process of spending, illustrate extreme psychological relationships with money where the value of money itself becomes paramount, detached from basic needs.

Our emotions play a significant role. Money is tied to feelings like anxiety, particularly worrying about the future or whether one has "enough". It can also lead to false pride or a sense that money measures one's worth. There's an evolutionary history to how we perceive gains and losses, with losses often feeling more significant than equivalent gains, which can influence financial decisions in instinctual ways.

Furthermore, the psychology of money involves a constant tension between present desires and future goals. Building wealth often requires suppressing the desire to spend money for immediate pleasure or possessions in favor of having more later. This relates to the psychological phenomenon of myopic discounting, where we tend to prefer smaller rewards now over larger ones later, making it difficult to save for the future.

Social factors also heavily influence our financial psychology. Caring about what others think can drive spending, as people might buy things like fancy cars or watches hoping to gain respect or admiration, even though kindness and humility might be more effective. This social pressure can make it harder to save. The value assigned to money and things is not just intrinsic but is also social and relational, tied to how others perceive them. Money transactions themselves, while ideally objective and impersonal, can become intertwined with personal meaning and subjective significance. The money economy can even lead to a "blas√© attitude" due to the overwhelming abundance of commodities, creating a perpetual need for new stimulation. Simmel notes how competition, a key feature of the money economy, shifts from being brutal and personal to impersonal and civil, though its ruthlessness can intensify.

Philosophical and psychological perspectives have long recognized the intricate relationship between money and the self. Psychoanalysis, for instance, has explored ideas about money, sometimes viewing it through a lens of symbolism related to pre-sexual or anal stages. While some traditional psychological explanations might trace a person's issues with money back to childhood or parental influence, other views, like aspects of existentialism, look beyond deterministic causes to explore deeper intentions and choices of being. Psychology has also grappled with defining its "real" object of research, sometimes dissolving into neuroscience or sociology, highlighting the complexity of understanding phenomena like the psychology of money across different levels of analysis.

Understanding the psychology of money can help us make more reasonable financial decisions, not just mathematically optimal ones. This might involve prioritizing strategies that allow for a better night's sleep, which varies from person to person, rather than solely aiming for the highest returns. It can also mean recognizing that gaining control over one's time is a priceless benefit of having money, perhaps the highest "dividend" it pays, as it allows the freedom to choose what you do, when, and with whom. Ultimately, it involves managing one's ego and desires, recognizing that wealth is often built on saving rather than spending to impress others.

The psychology of money thus highlights that our financial lives are deeply intertwined with our internal worlds and social contexts. It's not just about numbers and transactions, but about desires, fears, identity, and our interactions with others within a complex system.
