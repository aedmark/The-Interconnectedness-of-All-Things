Personal devotion is a multifaceted concept involving a deeply personal and often intense engagement with a higher power, sacred principles, or a spiritual path. Its nature and practice vary across different religious and philosophical traditions, but common threads include a focus of one's thoughts, emotions, and actions towards the object of devotion.

The nature of personal devotion can be understood through several key aspects:

**1. Object of Devotion:** Personal devotion is directed towards something considered sacred or of ultimate importance. In many religious traditions, this is God or a specific manifestation of the Divine. For example, in Christianity, devotion is directed towards the Supreme Deity, with sentiments of adoration, praise, thanksgiving, submission, loyalty, and love. The _Bhagavad Gita_ emphasizes devotion to Krishna, considering it the highest priority for reaching God. This devotion involves fixing the mind on God and offering all works up to Him. In Indian philosophy, _Īśvarapraṇidhāna_ in Yoga is described as meditation of and resignation to God, considered a means for concentration and restraint of mind. Even those devoted to other gods are seen in the _Bhagavad Gita_ as ultimately worshipping the Supreme Lord, though not according to the prescribed rules. In contrast, devotion can also be directed towards principles or figures considered spiritually significant, such as a guru in some Eastern traditions. Some perspectives suggest that devotion can even be expressed through one's actions and attitude towards life itself, seeing God in everything as a manifestation of divine consciousness.

**2. Emotional and Cognitive Engagement:** Personal devotion typically involves a strong emotional connection to the object of devotion, often characterized by love, faith, reverence, and longing. The _Bhagavad Gita_ describes love for God as the highest form of emotion. Faith is also crucial, as seen in the _Bhagavad Gita_, where even worship disregarding scriptures is judged based on the sincerity of faith. In Christian thought, piety is described as the consciousness of being absolutely dependent on God, or being in relation with God, a foundational affection. This emotional engagement is often intertwined with cognitive focus, involving directing one's thoughts and attention towards the object of devotion. The _Bhagavad Gita_ stresses fixing the entire mind on God and continuously directing the intellect towards understanding the Divine.

**3. Personal Relationship and Interiority:** Personal devotion emphasizes a direct and intimate relationship between the individual and the object of devotion. This relationship is often experienced internally, within the individual's thoughts and feelings. Thomas Merton describes the "mercy of God" as revealed through secret missions in which God gives Himself to us and awakens our identity as sons and heirs. This presence of Christ the Word in our souls is seen as a "Mission" and fosters a transsubjective union of love. Jung also highlights the importance of experiencing the religious function within one's own soul, rather than just adhering to outward forms. The idea of God being both transcendent and immanent, "superior summo meo" and "interior intimo meo," as Augustine put it, underscores this intimate and personal engagement.

**4. Transformation and Purpose:** The practice of personal devotion is often aimed at spiritual growth, purification, and ultimately, union with the Divine or realization of sacred principles. In Yoga, devotion to God is considered the best means for attaining concentration (_samādhi_) and purging away sins, making the attainment of yoga easier. The _Bhagavad Gita_ suggests that devotees whose minds are fixed on God soon experience Him as their deliverer from the cycle of life and death (_samsara_). For some, the ultimate goal of devotion is to become one with the object of devotion, as the _Bhagavad Gita_ mentions the _bhakta_ extinguishing themselves and merging into Bhagvan. Christian doctrine also emphasizes union with God as necessary for human thriving, achieved through surrender and love.

The practice of personal devotion manifests in various ways across traditions:

**1. Prayer and Praise:** Direct communication with the object of devotion through prayer is a central practice in many religions. This can involve presenting petitions, expressing gratitude, adoration, and seeking guidance. While public and formal prayer have their place, private and personal prayer are often emphasized for their intimacy and sincerity. In some traditions, specific mantras or sacred phrases are repeated as a form of prayer and to focus the mind on the Divine.

**2. Ritual and Worship:** Engaging in rituals and acts of worship can be a significant aspect of personal devotion. These practices can range from simple acts like lighting incense and keeping a sacred space to more elaborate ceremonies. The intention and feeling behind the ritual are often considered more important than the outward act itself. For example, the _puja_ in Hinduism involves caring for idols as a way of expressing love for God. Similarly, rituals in early Chinese thought, such as sacrifices to the High God and ancestors, were seen as means of ordering social and moral life and expressing filiality and respect.

**3. Meditation and Contemplation:** Disciplined mental practices like meditation and contemplation are often integral to personal devotion, aiming to concentrate the mind and deepen one's connection with the sacred. Yoga includes _dhyāna_ (meditation) as an internal discipline. In Buddhist traditions, mindfulness (_sati_) is crucial for nurturing meditation and settling the mind into its natural state. Christian contemplation involves a personalistic love and knowledge of Christ, reaching the Divine Person through grace and love.

**4. Ethical Conduct and Service:** Living in accordance with ethical principles and engaging in selfless service are often seen as expressions of devotion. The _Bhagavad Gita_ emphasizes the importance of detaching from personal desires, being pure and efficient, fair to all, and renouncing attachment to the fruits of one's endeavors. The concept of _Karma Yoga_ in the _Bhagavad Gita_ highlights offering the fruit of each action to God as a devotional practice. Some traditions view all actions performed with dedication to the Divine as a form of worship. The Jain concept of acting in Love and the Zoroastrian idea of man being the beloved of the Lord and loving Him in return illustrate the connection between love, action, and devotion.

**5. Study of Sacred Texts and Remembrance:** Regularly studying religious books (_svādhyāya_) is considered a discipline in Yoga. Remembering the object of devotion at all times is also emphasized. The _Bhagavad Gita_ stresses continuously thinking about God and fixing one's mind on Him. This constant remembrance helps to keep the focus on the Divine throughout daily life.

**6. Discipline and Self-Control:** Cultivating self-discipline and controlling the senses are often seen as necessary for deep devotion. The Yoga discipline of _niyama_ includes purification of the body and mind, contentment, penance, study, and resignation to God. _Brahmacharya_, traditionally meaning constant thought of the Absolute, is associated with controlling the senses and preserving vital energy.

Ultimately, personal devotion is a deeply subjective journey of connecting with what one perceives as sacred. It involves a combination of emotional yearning, cognitive focus, intentional practices, and ethical living, all aimed at fostering a more profound relationship with the object of devotion and facilitating spiritual transformation.
