Simone de Beauvoir's foundational concepts and influences are deeply intertwined, reflecting a complex philosophical development shaped by her engagement with existentialism, phenomenology, social critique, and her personal experiences within a male-dominated intellectual landscape.

**Foundational Concepts of Simone de Beauvoir**

A central and widely cited concept in Beauvoir's work, particularly in _The Second Sex_, is the assertion that **"one is not born a woman, but rather becomes one"**. This idea is foundational to her rejection of biological determinism and essentialist views of identity. Instead, she argues that woman's situation is due to historical, political, and social circumstances, emphasizing that gender is a social construct. Civilization as a whole elaborates the product qualified as "feminine," and the mediation of the Other is necessary to constitute an individual as an Other. This concept links her to social constructionism, which differentiates radical feminism from biological determinism. Gender is viewed not as a fixed identity, but as a "corporeal style," a way of acting the body and wearing one's flesh as a cultural sign. She argues that the notion of a "natural" body before culture is impossible, as the body itself is steeped in cultural language and is never merely a natural phenomenon. Biological differences, she contends, become social constructs whose meaning is shaped by individual actions.

Another crucial concept is **the problem of the Other**. Beauvoir analyzes woman's situation as being defined as the Other in a male-dominated totality. She explored this theme in her earliest writings, even before Sartre's work on the topic, basing her description on her own experience. For Beauvoir, the problem of the Other involves the difficulty of maintaining individual autonomy while desiring union with another. It also encompasses the threat posed by seeing oneself through the eyes of the Other, experiencing one's values negated. Her application of this concept in _The Second Sex_ argues that woman, as the Other, is "doomed to immanence, her freedom perpetually transcended by another". Definitions of women in myth, philosophy, science, and literature are presented as reflecting men's consciousness. She notes that men oppress women in "bad faith," seeking security in superiority and attempting to flee the anxiety of their own freedom. This links to Sartre's analysis of the anti-Semite. However, she also argues that heterosexual encounters are often characterized by man seeking domination rather than fusion or reciprocity, viewing woman as a passive object. The concept of "double consciousness," traced to W.E.B. DuBois, provides an analogy for Beauvoir's concept of woman as the Other, seeing oneself as defined by others.

Beauvoir operates within an existentialist framework, emphasizing **freedom and responsibility** within the **ambiguity of the human condition**. This ambiguity lies in our finite existence as both subject and object, active and passive, immanent and transcendent. Ethical questions arise within the tension of singularity and intersubjectivity. She emphasizes that freedom is never absolute but must be realized within concrete situations and in relation with others. This concept of "situated freedom" is crucial, and she takes it further than Merleau-Ponty by applying it to the description of existing historical subjects and questioning if being embodied and situated means the same for all, especially in situations of domination and oppression. The sources highlight that our social and historical reality limits human freedom and shapes experience. Beauvoir also critiqued the idea of women acting in "bad faith" by denying their freedom and appealing to a supposed "feminine" nature. She argued that the "real problem for woman is refusing these flights [into alienation] in order to accomplish herself as transcendence".

Her ethics can be seen as a **responsive ethics**, intertwining freedom and vulnerability, mind and body, "we" and others. She offered a critique of "separation," defined as the failure to recognize that the freedom of self and Other are interconnected. Authentic human relationships, in her view, are not static but must be constantly created through the free recognition of each individual in the other, a reciprocal movement of posing oneself and the other as both object and subject. This "struggle forever opening up, forever abolished" is demanding but allows man (or human) to find himself in truth.

Beauvoir's concept of **authenticity** is linked to freedom to choose one's project. She borrowed the idea of "sedimentation" from Merleau-Ponty to explain how commitment to a project makes it more closely associated with one's person and harder to reject. Authenticity requires commitment to an ideal, and this commitment becomes sedimented within the individual, shaping their identity and future choices.

She also offered specific critiques of traditional societal structures and concepts. Her **critique of motherhood** highlighted the difficulty for women to perform this function in complete liberty, forcing a choice between career and maternity in bourgeois society. She viewed motherhood in _The Second Sex_ negatively, reflecting her own alienation from this traditional role. This analysis explored the conflict between feminist individualism and the valorization of maternal practices. Furthermore, she presented a **critique of heterosexism** and compulsory heterosexuality, arguing that lesbianism could be an authentic alternative for women in a sexist society. Her analysis in _The Second Sex_ is seen as providing an historic link between lesbian and feminist thought by challenging the institution of heterosexuality. However, she also rejected the idea of a compulsory lesbian identity, arguing that emancipating women means refusing to enclose them only in relations with men, but also not denying those relations to them.

A less conventional, but significant, ethical idea in Beauvoir's work is the notion of **giving oneself in service to others**. This is presented as a foundation for ethics, allowing one to achieve a sense of usefulness on a human scale after the loss of religious faith and thereby relieving despair and avoiding the temptations of bad faith. This perspective suggests a philosophical concern less with solipsism (only-self) and more with solaltrism (only-other), where the absence of the beloved Other is a source of anguish, and serving others supports the self.

**Influences on Simone de Beauvoir**

The sources reveal a rich tapestry of intellectual influences on Beauvoir, navigating philosophical traditions and contemporary thought while also being deeply shaped by her personal life and social context.

**Jean-Paul Sartre** is undeniably a major figure in discussions of Beauvoir's influences, though the relationship is consistently portrayed as complex and reciprocal. The conventional view often depicts Beauvoir as merely Sartre's philosophical disciple. Beauvoir herself sometimes publicly downplayed her own philosophical originality, identifying more as a literary writer and defender/applicator of Sartre's philosophy. The sources suggest that sexism in the philosophical community contributed significantly to the misreading and dismissal of her work as derivative. However, the sources strongly challenge this one-sided view, presenting evidence of Beauvoir's significant influence on Sartre's philosophical development. Her earliest works focused on **the problem of the Other** before Sartre's major work on the subject, and the concept later appeared in his philosophy, suggesting her influence. Similarly, Beauvoir's analysis in _The Second Sex_ of the influence of **history, society, and childhood socialization** on individual development appeared before Sartre's exploration of these themes in works like _Saint Genet_ and _Search for a Method_. She is also credited with introducing the concept of **fraternity/social identity** and linking freedom with reciprocity earlier than Sartre. Furthermore, her philosophy is seen as having given **embodiment** to Sartrean choice and placing it in a world "thick with tradition," potentially influencing Sartre's doctrines. While Sartre urged her to write and used her as a sounding board, he sometimes saw her as a critic or spectator rather than a participant in philosophical discourse. Despite this, Beauvoir's work redefined and transcended his ideas.

**Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel**, particularly his master/slave dialectic from _Phenomenology of Spirit_, was a crucial influence on Beauvoir's analysis of woman's oppression as the Other. She critically appropriated Hegel's ideas, but also noted where the analogy between the master/slave relationship and the man/woman relationship failed, arguing that woman remained more radically the Other than the slave in some respects. She read interpretations of Hegel by Koj√®ve and Hyppolite early in her career.

**Phenomenology** in general, stemming from figures like **Edmund Husserl** and **Maurice Merleau-Ponty**, provided key concepts for Beauvoir, including intentionality, situation, and the lived body. She transformed these concepts within her existential ethics. She engaged with Merleau-Ponty's concept of situatedness, taking it more seriously by applying it concretely to historical subjects facing oppression. She also borrowed his idea of "sedimentation" to explain how projects become ingrained in identity, though she adapted it to align with Sartre's notion of freedom. Their friendship and debates may have also led to her influencing Merleau-Ponty's concept of the lived body. The influence of Husserl and the introduction of phenomenology into France is also part of the historical context of her philosophical development.

**Henri Bergson** is identified as an important, though often unexplored, early influence on Beauvoir. His philosophy, dominant in France in the 1920s, introduced concepts like "presence," becoming, time consciousness, duration, and memory. Beauvoir explicitly used the concept of "becoming" in _The Second Sex_, and his ideas about time and memory may have contributed to her understanding of the importance of childhood experience in self-construction. Bergson's methodological focus on the "immediate givens of consciousness" also had affinities with phenomenology and may have influenced Beauvoir's descriptive methodology.

**Richard Wright**, the African American author, is presented as a significant influence, particularly on Beauvoir's concept of the oppressed Other and her understanding of the psychological dimensions of oppression. She drew upon his descriptions in _Native Son_ and _Black Boy_ of how one's destiny is shaped by others under oppression, providing a "new version of predestination" that informed her analysis of how gender oppression distorts psychological development. Wright's anti-essentialist approach to race, which affirmed the reality of race under oppression while rejecting fixed racial essences, provided a model for Beauvoir's anti-essentialist but militant liberation politics. This influence connects Beauvoir's work to radical black theorizing of racial oppression. The connection to **W.E.B. DuBois** and his concept of "double consciousness" is also noted as an intellectual legacy related to Wright's work that aligns with Beauvoir's concept of woman as the Other.

**Karl Marx** is another figure Beauvoir engaged with critically. While she incorporated a social and economic dimension into her analysis, she rejected the limitations of historical materialism, arguing that it reduced individuals, particularly women, to mere economic entities and failed to account for the unique situation of women and the importance of individual destiny. She believed a true socialist revolution must affirm individualism and acknowledge gender difference. Her critique of Marxism differentiated her position and helped lay the theoretical foundation for radical feminism.

**Sigmund Freud** and psychoanalytic theory were also subject to Beauvoir's critique. She attacked Freudian theory for its sexist concept of normalcy and for imposing a male model onto female experience, arguing that it silenced women. She saw psychoanalytic insights as evidence of the psychological depths of women's social and political oppression. She rejected the psychoanalytic concept of identifying with models (mother or father) as inauthentic alienation.

Beyond these major figures, the sources mention various other philosophical and intellectual influences. Her early philosophical interests included **Schopenhauer, Kant, and Descartes**. **Leibniz** is noted for his potential influence on her reflections on the uniqueness of individuals, varying perspectives, and the idea that individuals must create their own truth in the absence of God. **William James** is suggested as a possible influence on her descriptive psychology, concept of the stream of consciousness, and theory of emotions. **Jean Baruzi** is identified as a philosophical mentor who introduced her to a descriptive phenomenological methodology. She also referenced figures like **Pascal** and **Marcel Arland** in relation to the search for meaning and the desire for belief. Literary figures and traditions, including the French intellectual tradition, poets, surrealist writers, and novelists like Mauriac and Claudel, also shaped her work.

Beauvoir's philosophy was profoundly shaped by her **personal experiences** and relationships. Her childhood, family relationships (with her mother, sister H√©l√®ne, and friend Zaza), her experiences of sexism in school and society, her struggles against traditional female roles, and her intimate relationships (with Sartre, Nelson Algren, and women like Sylvie Le Bon) were integral to the development of her thought, particularly her understanding of the problem of the Other, freedom, and situatedness. Her descriptive methodology was rooted in her own lived experience. The historical context of the Nazi Occupation forced her to confront political realities and deepened her engagement with Hegel. Later events like May 1968 and the emergence of the feminist movement influenced her ongoing involvement and perspective.

Finally, Beauvoir herself became a significant influence, serving as a **model and theoretical foundation for second-wave radical feminism**. Feminist theorists who followed explicitly acknowledged their debt to her work. Her text stimulated relentless analysis and questioning of women's situation across many domains and is seen as a source for contemporary feminist dialogue. Despite ongoing "misreadings" and dismissals, reclaiming her work is presented as vital for feminist philosophy.

In summary, Beauvoir's foundational concepts, including the social construction of gender, the problem of the Other, situated freedom, and a responsive ethics, emerged from a critical engagement with existentialism, phenomenology, Hegelian dialectics, and socialist/psychoanalytic theories, all filtered through her unique experiences and relationships within a specific historical and social context. Her work not only drew upon these influences but also challenged and transformed them, leaving a lasting legacy on feminist thought.
