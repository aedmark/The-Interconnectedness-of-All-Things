So, what exactly is the Emotion Code? Think of it as a simple, powerful energy healing technique developed by Dr. Bradley Nelson in the early 1990s in his holistic clinic in Southern California. He was guided into the healing arts after a clear answer to prayer. Dr. Nelson, along with the help of his intuitive wife, Jean, refined this method by working with patients daily, figuring out what worked and what didn't. The core purpose of the Emotion Code is to help people process and effectively heal from emotional baggage.

The big idea behind the Emotion Code is that negative emotional energies from past experiences can become "trapped" within us. These trapped emotions, which are made of pure negative energy, can create distortion in the body's energy field. The sources suggest that these trapped emotions are like balls of energy, usually ranging in size from an orange to a cantaloupe, and they can lodge anywhere in the body. The beauty of the Emotion Code process is that when a trapped emotion is uncovered, you don't necessarily have to relive or even talk about the traumatic event that caused it. Instead, the method focuses on releasing the emotional "charge" and clearing the energetic blockage.

Now, where do these trapped emotions come from? Well, some come from your own life experiences, even those you might not consciously remember, especially if you've been through extreme trauma and blocked things out. Your subconscious mind, however, remembers everything. What's truly fascinating is that some emotional baggage can even be inherited from your ancestors.

What kind of problems can trapped emotions potentially contribute to or create? According to the sources, they can cause an incredibly wide variety of issues, both physical and emotional. We hear about physical pain like hip pain, knee pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, migraine headaches, and low back pain being linked to trapped emotions. Emotional or mental issues like depression, anxiety, panic attacks, social anxiety, low self-esteem, suicidal thoughts, and even difficulties like learning disabilities or weight issues are mentioned as potentially having trapped emotions contributing to them. Sometimes, releasing a trapped emotion can bring about an instantaneous and dramatic effect, while other times the effects might be more subtle. Either way, people often report a greater sense of contentment and peace.

Let's talk about how the Emotion Code gets its information. The method relies on accessing information from the subconscious mind. The subconscious mind knows everything about the trapped emotions you carry. The key is learning how to communicate with it and get clear answers.

This communication is primarily done through muscle testing. The basic principle is that all organisms respond differently to positive or negative stimuli. In humans, this response can be seen in the body's muscles. Muscle testing allows you to ask yes-no questions and get definitive answers from the body.

There are several ways to perform muscle testing, and you can choose whichever feels most comfortable. The sources describe methods like the Sway Test (where your body sways forward for yes and backward for no, typically done standing), the Hand Solo method (used discreetly by testing the strength of your fingers), the Hole-in-One method (using a finger ring on one hand and pressure from the other), the Ring-in-Ring method (linking two finger rings), the Finger Rub method (feeling changes in friction between finger pads), and using a Pendulum (observing its swing direction).

No matter which method you choose, it's really important to establish a baseline first to know what your clear "yes" and "no" responses look and feel like. The sources suggest using very little pressure and resistance when muscle testing – aiming for less than 5% of your available strength. Interestingly, as you practice the Emotion Code and muscle testing, you might start to notice your intuition developing, giving you a feeling or knowing of the answer even before you test it.

Ready to learn the general steps of an Emotion Code session? It's presented as a simple, logical procedure that becomes faster with practice.

1. **Obtain Permission:** If you're working on someone else, you need to get their verbal permission to test them. For yourself, you can skip this step.
2. **Establish a Baseline:** This is where you perform your chosen muscle test with a known true statement (like your own name) to ensure you are testable and get a clear 'yes' response.
3. **Determine If a Trapped Emotion Exists:** You ask a question like, "Do I have a trapped emotion that can be released now?" or "Do you have a trapped emotion that can be released now?" and test the response. If the answer is yes, you're ready to find it. If it's no, it could mean there are none ready _right now_, or there might be a Heart-Wall present that needs addressing first.
4. **Determine Which Emotion It Is:** If there is a trapped emotion ready, you use a process of deduction, often with the help of the Emotion Code Chart. You can ask if the emotion is in Column A or Column B, and then narrow it down to a specific row. This brings you to a list of five potential emotions. You then test each emotion individually until you find the correct one. It's important to test only one emotion at a time and verify your 'yes' answer by testing the next emotion, which should give a 'no'. The subconscious mind knows exactly which emotion it is, even if the person being worked on hasn't seen the chart.

Sometimes, after identifying the emotion, the subconscious mind indicates that you need to know more before it can be released. This is called "Digging Deeper". You might ask questions like:

- When did this emotion become trapped? You can narrow down the age or time period using muscle testing.
- What was this emotion about? Was it about a person, a situation, or directed at yourself? You can ask more specific questions to identify details, like who the person was if it was about someone.
- Was it absorbed from someone else? Sometimes we absorb negative emotions from others, especially those we are close to, like children absorbing emotions from parents. If it was absorbed, you might need to identify who it came from. The nice thing is, personal details can remain private if the subconscious doesn't indicate a need to know them.

Another optional but sometimes enlightening step is to determine where in the body the trapped emotion is lodged. You can use deduction, asking if it's on the right, left, or midline of the body, and then if it's above, below, or at the waistline, getting more specific with practice. Remember, the physical location might be different from the organ the emotion originated from.

5. **Release the Trapped Emotion:** This is where the magic happens! Intention is key here – you focus love and gratitude on yourself or the person you're helping, believing you can release the emotion. To release, you swipe a magnet (even a weak one!) or your hand down the Governing Meridian (the midline of the back or over the head and down the neck). For regular trapped emotions, you do this three times. The idea is that the magnetic energy magnifies your intention and sends a frequency along the acupuncture system (the Governing Meridian) that cancels out the vibration of the trapped emotion, similar to how noise-canceling headphones work or how a magnet can erase information on a credit card strip.
    
6. **Check to See If the Emotion Was Released:** After the three swipes, you muscle test again by asking, "Did we release that trapped emotion?". If the answer is yes, you're done with that one and can look for another. If it's no, you repeat the release process, perhaps adding a bit more belief and gratitude.
    

A really beautiful aspect mentioned is that once a trapped emotion is released, it's gone forever. However, you can trap the same _type_ of emotion multiple times from different events throughout your life, so you might release "anger" many times, but each instance is a distinct trapped energy. Also, you might trap several different emotions during one stressful event. It's generally advised to release one emotion at a time, as trying to shortcut and release many at once hasn't shown success in reported cases. Releasing emotions one by one respects the individual emotional experience and allows the body and spirit time to process.

Beyond personal trapped emotions, the sources discuss "Inherited Trapped Emotions". These are emotions that didn't originate with you but were passed down through your family line. The process for finding and releasing these is similar, but when identifying the emotion on the chart, you preface it with the word "inherited". To release an inherited emotion, you swipe the magnet or your hand down the Governing Meridian ten times instead of three. It's believed that releasing these inherited emotions can potentially stop the cycle of them being passed down to future generations. Some practitioners have reported sensing the presence of ancestors during the release of inherited emotions, finding it a fascinating and sometimes moving experience.

Another significant concept mentioned is the "Heart-Wall". This is a common issue consisting of trapped emotions surrounding the heart. If muscle testing indicates a Heart-Wall is present, your subconscious might say you don't have other trapped emotions even if you do. Releasing emotions from a Heart-Wall uses the same Emotion Code process. Taking down a Heart-Wall is reported to lead to incredible shifts, like increased calmness, peace, ability to connect with others, and a sense of true self. It's a journey, and it can take multiple sessions to clear.

One of the amazing capabilities of the Emotion Code is working on others, even when they aren't physically present. This is done through "surrogate testing" and "proxy testing".

- **Surrogate Testing:** This is used when the subject is physically present but unable to be tested directly, like young children, unconscious individuals, or animals. You would use another person (the surrogate) to muscle test on, acting on behalf of the subject.
- **Proxy Testing:** This is used when the subject is not physically present, even thousands of miles away. You or another person (the proxy) connect energetically with the subject and perform muscle testing and releases on their _own_ body, which effectively works on the distant subject. It's important to establish the energetic connection and then break it at the end of the session.

The Emotion Code is also said to work wonderfully on animals, as they also experience and can trap emotions. The process is similar to working on humans, often done via surrogate or proxy testing if direct muscle testing isn't feasible or safe. Many remarkable stories are shared about animals experiencing positive changes after trapped emotions are released, from behavioral issues to physical improvements.

When you're exploring the Emotion Code, a few things to keep in mind. It's important to stay neutral and avoid projecting your own expectations or prejudices onto the muscle testing results. If you find yourself getting the same answers repeatedly for different people, it might be a sign you are projecting or experiencing "resonance" (your own trapped emotions interfering). Regular self-sessions can help address your own baggage and improve your testing accuracy.

Also, the sources suggest challenging any negative ideas you have about certain emotions. While uncomfortable, all emotions are seen as having a purpose and providing important messages from your body or subconscious. The goal isn't to avoid feeling them, but to use the Emotion Code to clear the _trapped_ energy that causes problems. By clearing the baggage, you can respond to current emotions in a healthier, more neutral way, understand their message, and then choose positive emotions. It's believed that freeing yourself from negative trapped emotions makes it easier to attract what you want by choosing higher vibrational positive emotions.

The Emotion Code is presented as a self-help method that can yield marvelous results. However, it's also noted that it's a relatively new discovery and hasn't been thoroughly studied. The stories shared are based on personal observations and experiences. It is recommended as an adjunct therapy, not a cure-all or a tool for diagnosis. Taking 100% responsibility for your own health is emphasized.

At its heart, the Emotion Code seems to connect with beliefs about energy, the spirit within us, and even divine assistance. Believing and being grateful are highlighted as important aspects that allow the method to work. It's seen as a simple tool that anyone willing to learn can use to heal themselves and loved ones.

Many people who have used the Emotion Code and seen its effects have gone on to become certified practitioners themselves, wanting to help others experience the same relief and transformation. It's described as a powerfully transformative method that can bring a new joy and freedom to life.
