One of the big questions you encounter when you start looking into things like occultism, ceremonial magic, or psychic phenomena is about what's real. Is something happening out there, or is it all just in your head? It’s a challenge, isn’t it? And sadly, many people who haven't even looked into these areas often dismiss them as mere fantasy, simply because they've been told they aren't real. But let's pause for a moment and consider what we even mean by "reality" and "fantasy".

Interestingly, the word "fantasy" comes from an ancient root meaning "to shine, to be brought into the light". This suggests that what is brought into the light existed before in the darkness, outside the realm of what could be measured by a ruler. So, when we "bring something to light," it's not about questioning its existence; it's more like deciding if it's allowed into the "real" realm, the measurable one. This gives us a hint that maybe the world we see isn't the only world there is.

The sources suggest a core occult idea: the world we see is a visible representation of a world we don't see. Everything visible has a counterpart in the invisible world. This is known as the doctrine of correspondences. And where does the astral body fit into all this?

Well, the concept of the astral body is tied directly to this invisible world. The world we see is related to Light and Day, where things are visible and measurable. The world we don't see is related to Darkness and Night, making things invisible and immeasurable. It's during the time proper to this unseen world – Night – that phenomena we don't see become manifest, much like the stars and planets visible in the night sky.

These celestial points of light are seen as representing phenomena in the world we don't see, according to the doctrine of correspondences. They can also represent the forms of our bodies that we can't see – what some cultures call the "astral body" or the "star self," highlighting its connection to the stars. The idea is that if we have these unseen bodies or selves, they, like the eternal stars, are also eternal.

So, the astral body is often thought of as this invisible form of our body. Since our physical bodies decay after death, if there's existence beyond death, it must be experienced by a part of us that we can't see, a form belonging to the world we don't see. This invisible form in the unseen world is believed to exist concurrently with our visible body in the seen world.

The very term "astral" connects us back to the stars. The astral body is presented as being composed of a substance shared with, and unique to, the stars. It's the part of us that originates from the stars. Some myths suggest humanity was created from elements of "upper" Gods (from the Stars) and a "lower" Monster (like the Serpent). Our astral body, then, is seen as this essential element, a direct inheritance from the star-gods who might have created us.

Now, there are slightly different takes on whether everyone _already_ has an astral body or if it needs to be _created_. Hindu mystics, for instance, tend to believe everyone possesses one. The task, then, is to become _conscious_ of it. While our existing astral body might be aware of events happening "behind the scenes" on the invisible or unconscious plane, our conscious self often isn't. The goal in this perspective is to develop practices that make the conscious mind aware of these unconscious processes, creating a link between the conscious and astral bodies, guided by the Will. This allows information to flow both ways: insights from the astral plane can help guide our lives, and our conscious desires can be transmitted to the astral plane, bringing our existence into greater unity.

The Chinese sages and the Malekulans had a more challenging view. They believed this astral body doesn't automatically exist; the initiate must consciously _create_ it. While the basic elements are within us, they aren't "hooked up". Various essences and "effulgences" must be cultivated and nurtured, like tending a garden until it blossoms. Without this conscious creation, these astral elements dissipate upon death, and the chance for immortality is lost forever. This perspective emphasizes that the work towards immortality must be done now, in this life.

Regardless of whether it's formed or awakened, the astral body is seen as incredibly important. One of its key purposes is allowing the individual to exist simultaneously in both the visible ("this world") and invisible ("otherworld") realms without sacrificing sanity. It acts as a safeguard against psychic dysfunction. When the conscious self (the ego) might undergo dissolution during higher illumination, the strengthened astral body can help carry the conscious self through the world safely. Think of it as a subconscious "ego" that holds the initiate's identity, allowing them to explore other levels of awareness without losing their grip on reality. It's a means to achieve a kind of controlled engagement with altered states necessary for genuine occult practice.

Furthermore, the formation of the astral body is described as a deeply political act. It's an act of personal responsibility and commitment, often requiring intense, solitary practice. Once successfully formed, the individual is seen as being beyond the usual control mechanisms of government or religion. How so? Because these systems often work by bypassing consciousness and influencing the unconscious through subliminal methods or linking their goals to unconscious desires. However, a deliberately formed astral body acts like a watchdog, guarding the entrance to the unconscious mind. It increases conscious sensitivity to manipulative messages, stripping them of their psychic appeal. It allows the individual to make choices based on actual content, not just form. In essence, forming an astral body makes the individual their own authority, their own priest or priestess, gaining the keys to the "Gates" and not needing external permission to explore the unseen realms.

How does one go about forming or awakening this astral body, particularly within the Necronomicon framework described in the sources? The Necronomicon emphasizes a period of purification before undertaking the "Walking" through the Gates. This includes a lunar cycle of purification, often involving sexual abstinence (except for specific practices aimed at cultivating energy rather than ejaculation) and fasting, including a three-day "Black Fast" on water before the ritual for the first Gate. These practices are designed to help the operator develop an astral body capable of the intended journey.

The entire process of passing through the Seven Gates in the Necronomicon system is seen as slowly building up the astral body over a total of seven lunar months. This is likened to the deceased passing through the seven Underworld Gates in Egyptian rituals.

Interestingly, the Necronomicon rituals are described as potentially accelerating this formation process. Because the material is ancient and direct, the operator is often left to figure out aspects of the method on their own, drawing on the unconscious. This is seen as working "from the ground up," breaking through resistance from the deepest unconscious layers to the conscious mind. The ancient God-forms and "words of power" (Hekau) used in the Necronomicon are considered among the first recorded attempts at the Otherworld journey. They are seen as part of a universal, perhaps even genetic, legacy. When the book is opened and the decision made to open the Gates, a memory is triggered deep within the unconscious. The astral body is said to form itself around this memory, clothing it in "material of the stars". This is viewed as a moment of recognition, where the "Yang Body" (the astral/mystical body) rises from the "Underworld" (the unconscious) at midnight to meet the "Yin Body" (the physical body), creating a powerful vehicle for magic.

Meditation practices also play a role in other traditions. In Shangqing Daoism, meditating on the Northern Dipper is central to aligning with its power and forming a mystical "yang" body. Initiates would visualize arraying their bodies in the stars of the Dipper or lying on a carpet embroidered with its stars, invoking them by name. This practice, along with cultivating energy (jing), aims to create a "body of light" composed of the same substance as the stars. The goal is for this accumulated light to lift the adept heavenward, out of the physical body, to their abode among the Northern Dipper stars. This sense of direction is so strong that ancient Chinese emperors were sometimes buried with compass-like plates to find their way to the constellation after death.

The "Walking" ritual in the Necronomicon is compared to the Daoist "Pace of Yü," a method of walking among the stars. Both are rituals designed to pace or traverse the seven stars, or gates, of the Northern Dipper. This suggests a connection between the physical movements or visualizations and the activation or navigation of the astral body.

Entering the "Gates" in the Necronomicon system is inherently tied to the astral body. The first Gate, the Lunar Gate (Nanna Gate), is described as the most important, the "Ur-Gate" between this world and the Other. Successfully opening it establishes a foundation in the Otherworld from which to build one's astral edifice. The astral body is crucial for traversing the deeper Gates, like the MARDUK Gate and the GANZIR Gate into the Pit (the deepest layer of the human mind), as it must be formed strongly enough to withstand the psychic shocks encountered there.

In summary, the astral body, as described in the sources, is conceived as an invisible counterpart to our physical body, connected to the stars and the unseen world. While some traditions see it as something everyone possesses but needs to become conscious of, others believe it must be deliberately created through specific practices. Forming this body is essential for exploring the invisible realms (like the astral plane or the Underworld) safely, achieving higher consciousness, and ultimately pursuing immortality. It acts as a psychic safeguard and allows one independence from external control systems by strengthening inner awareness. The Necronomicon system, through its purification rituals, the process of passing the Seven Gates, and the use of ancient words of power, is presented as a direct method for awakening or forming this astral body from the deepest levels of the unconscious.

Isn't it intriguing how these various ancient traditions seem to converge on the idea of a luminous, starry body that can be cultivated to transcend the limitations of the physical world and even death?

This discussion naturally leads to further questions, doesn't it?

- How do the specific practices like fasting and sexual abstinence mentioned in the Necronomicon physically or energetically contribute to forming the astral body?
- What is the precise nature of the connection between the earth's magnetic field, the stars (particularly the Northern Dipper), and the human body or psyche, as suggested by practices like feng shui and meditating on the Dipper's relationship to the physical body?
- Could modern psychological concepts like the unconscious, subconscious, id, anima, and shadow offer a useful metaphorical lens through which to understand the unseen world and the astral body, as suggested by the sources?
