Embracing wholeness is a multifaceted concept that spans philosophical, psychological, and spiritual dimensions, often emphasizing the interconnectedness of all things and the integration of diverse aspects into a unified whole. It stands in contrast to ideas of fragmentation, separation, and dualism, offering a path towards healing, greater well-being, and authentic existence.

### Defining and Understanding Wholeness

At its core, wholeness implies integration, an interconnectedness of all parts of a system or organism, and a sense of completeness. The very word "health" means "whole", and "integrity" derives from "integer," signifying entirety and completion. Healing, too, is fundamentally understood as a natural movement toward wholeness or a "returning to wholeness," often described as self-retrieval where lost parts of the self are recovered rather than merely changed or "bettered". This perspective suggests that we are already perfect in the sense of being perfectly who we are, including our imperfections, and that intrinsic wholeness is always present, no matter the scars or physical losses one carries.

From a deeper spiritual or metaphysical view, wholeness can be understood as a "vast oneness" without boundaries, a state of "felt oneness with Being" and connectedness with something immeasurable and indestructible that is both essentially oneself and yet much greater. This universal spiritual energy underlies and pervades all things, creating a sense of connectedness where the boundaries between superficially separate objects melt away. Synergy, as a concept, highlights that a complex organism as a whole entails an intelligence that exceeds the sum of its parts.

### Dimensions and Integration within Wholeness

Embracing wholeness necessitates the integration of various dimensions that are often perceived as separate or even contradictory:

1. **Mind and Body**: Modern medicine increasingly recognizes that health is not solely a characteristic of the body or mind, as they are intimately interconnected and completely integrated. Mindfulness practices, such as the body scan, cultivate a sense of the body as a whole, facilitating an integrated way of living from moment to moment.
2. **Self and Other**: Authentic existence is deeply relational. For instance, Charles Taylor's concept of "dialogical selves" suggests that identity is not discovered in isolation but negotiated through dialogue, blurring the boundaries between self and other. Bakhtin further emphasizes that "self-ness" is constituted through a dense network of discourses and the self-other relation, asserting that a self-sufficient, Cartesian cogito cannot exist, and that "to be means to communicate". The self, in this view, is always "in the presence of another human being". The ultimate aim of ethical elaboration, then, is humanity, which is achieved by allowing oneself to be affected by others and by recognizing and accepting vulnerability. This shared humanness becomes a source of possibility, fostering trust, contribution, and community.
3. **Unity and Diversity**: While some philosophical traditions, like absolute idealism, have struggled with how evil or "worst parts" can be essential to a "flawless unit of fact", a more nuanced understanding of wholeness accommodates both unity and diversity. The doctrine of atonement, for example, must "work within the tension of unity and diversity". In Kantian philosophy, the analytical unity of consciousness, crucial for forming common concepts, is only possible through an antecedently conceived synthetic unity where different representations are brought together. Gadamer's hermeneutics, in emphasizing dialogue, seeks to "preserve diversity in a culturally richer unity," showing that the languages of Europe, for example, bear witness to a unity articulated in differences. In Buddhism, the concept of _ri ji muge_ means "no obstruction" between the world's unity and its particulars, illustrating how diverse elements like shape and color can be united in a single object.
4. **Opposites and Paradoxes**: Embracing wholeness often involves transcending dualities and accepting paradoxes. Taoism and Buddhism articulate the idea of "identical difference," where differences (like yin and yang) are inherently connected and even define unity, meaning one cannot exist without the other. Pain and ecstasy can be associated in "perverse experiences," demonstrating a unity in total abandonment to sensations. The integration of faith and reason, or "reason plus," is presented as essential for integrity, promoting "both/and thinking" instead of "either/or". Even good and evil, if accepted, lead to ease and being "at home in the world". Tantra, for instance, advocates an unconditional "yes" to life, where fighting ceases, boundaries disappear, and one's entire being rearranges itself into harmony upon acceptance.
5. **Subjectivity and Objectivity**: In Hegel's philosophy, the reconciliation of subject and substance leads to Spirit, where the subject integrates and animates the substance, and absolute knowing involves "Spirit that knows itself in the shape of Spirit or as comprehensive knowing". Husserl's ontological approach to phenomenology includes the intersubjective dimension, recognizing that objectivity presupposes the possibility of communicating with others about what is given.

### The Process of Becoming Whole

Wholeness is not a static destination but a dynamic process or direction. _Bildung_, in Hegel's view, signifies a "becoming" or a constant process of development, involving a "rising to the universal" and a "sacrificing [of] particularity for the sake of the universal". Human life is inherently dialectical, constantly balancing itself in an "intermediacy" exposed to limitlessness, where completion is always open and finite.

The journey to wholeness often involves:

- **Overcoming Separation and Alienation**: Zygmunt Bauman notes that a single absolute truth would spell the end of humanity because it would silence the unending discourse among people, who inherently disagree. Louis Althusser, in "For Marx," warns against reducing complex wholes to simple unities, arguing that such a simplification would lead back to "mechanistic materialism" or "idealism of consciousness," thus sacrificing the specific difference of Marxist thought. Conversely, the "sovereignty complex" (union of territory, nation, and state) is seen as an obstacle to true human community and dialogue. Similarly, the "illusion of separateness" is shattered through experiences of ego-transcendence, leading to the realization that "all was one".
- **Mindfulness and Acceptance**: Mindfulness practices cultivate the ability to perceive interconnectedness and wholeness by challenging habitual ways of seeing things and tacit assumptions. It involves a "fullness of mind" where there are no barriers or exclusions, and a "non-striving" attitude that allows for acceptance of the present moment and oneself. This acceptance becomes the ground for true insight, enabling one to learn about and become free in relation to difficult experiences without resistance or judgment.
- **Transcending the Ego**: A powerful sense of ego, with its desires and attachments, is seen as a major obstacle to connection and union, as its strong boundaries enclose individuals in their own mental space. The ego's "deep-seated sense of lack or incompleteness" drives a compulsive pursuit of gratification that ultimately proves bottomless. Wholeness involves transcending this ego-isolation, leading to increased empathy, inner security, and a universal outlook.
- **Embracing Vulnerability**: Recognizing and accepting human vulnerability is a fundamental step in ethical development, leading to relationships of care and recognition. Beauvoir's responsive ethics intertwines freedom and vulnerability, suggesting that freedom must be realized within concrete situations and in relation to others.

### Outcomes of Embracing Wholeness

The pursuit and embodiment of wholeness lead to profound positive changes:

- **Healing and Well-being**: Healing is a "transformation of view" from fragmentation and isolation to wholeness and interconnectedness, leading to a sense of acceptance, inner peace, and manageability of life's challenges. It also involves seeing oneself as "larger than your problems and your pain".
- **Expanded Awareness and Capabilities**: An "awakened brain" enables a new paradigm for being, leading, and relating, fostering greater clarity, capability, and purpose. It promotes an awareness of interconnectedness and shared responsibility, putting individuals in touch with inner resources and the fabric of all life.
- **Ethical Living and Social Justice**: Embracing wholeness fosters a "healthy appreciation for the relationship between the 'me' and 'we'". It inspires personal growth, community engagement, and a commitment to social justice. Ending "othering" and binary thinking is crucial for justice and peace, requiring a willingness to "cross boundaries of division, refuse contempt, and acknowledge the dignity of others". A politics of humanity, as described by Mbembe, requires recognizing that what humans share is difference, and that true planetary democracy demands justice and reparation.
- **Deepened Compassion and Love**: Cultivating compassion is essential for expanding one's "circle of concern" beyond immediate relations to all of humanity. True love, according to Buddhist teachings, is characterized by inclusiveness and non-discrimination, encompassing loving-kindness (_maitrī_), the capacity to relieve suffering (_karuṇā_), joy (_muditā_), and inclusivity (_upekṣā_). This love is not a professional skill but an energy that changes both the giver and receiver, leading to harmony in relationships and a broader "arc of love" that can extend to the planet.

In essence, embracing wholeness is an ongoing practice of integrating internal and external realities, dissolving artificial boundaries, and fostering a deep sense of connection, acceptance, and compassion, leading to a more authentic, peaceful, and just way of living in the world.
