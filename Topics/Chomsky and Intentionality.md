Chomskyan linguistics and the concept of intentionality intersect at fundamental questions about the nature of language, thought, and the mind. While Chomsky's linguistic theory primarily focuses on the formal and computational aspects of language, the concept of intentionality, which describes the "aboutness" or "of-ness" of mental states, raises complexities regarding how linguistic structures relate to meaning and the world.

### Chomskyan Linguistics: Core Ideas and Methodology

Chomsky's work is characterized by a "Galilean" approach to science, which involves abstracting from ordinary observable data to focus on "crucial data" that reveal underlying systems. This method is applied to language through several key distinctions:

1. **Competence vs. Performance**: Chomsky distinguishes between linguistic _competence_, the underlying system responsible for a speaker's ability to understand a potential infinity of expressions, and _performance_, the actual use of language, which is influenced by numerous non-grammatical factors like slips, false starts, and social conventions. Chomskyan linguistics is primarily concerned with competence.
2. **I-language vs. E-language**: To clarify the object of linguistic theory, Chomsky introduced _I-language_ (internal, intensional, individualistic, biological system in the brain) and _E-language_ (external, extensional, social phenomena like "English" or "German"). I-languages are computational procedures that map internal representations of sound to internal representations of meaning, not something people "speak" in the ordinary sense.
3. **Autonomy of Syntax**: A striking feature of Chomsky's early work is the insistence that syntactic rules are independent of semantic interpretation. His famous example, "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously," illustrates that a grammatically impeccable sentence can be semantically nonsensical. This "autonomy of syntax" means that the underlying grammatical system is not primarily constrained by or formulated in terms of meaning or communicative purpose.
4. **Nativism and Universal Grammar (UG)**: Chomsky proposes that a _Universal Grammar_ is innate, a biological endowment that provides the initial state for language acquisition. The "poverty of the stimulus" argument supports this: children acquire a rich understanding of language despite limited and often "degenerate" input, suggesting innate knowledge of language structure. This innate structure is viewed as a "quasi-brute causal process" rather than a rational, explicit learning process.
5. **Explanatory Adequacy**: A central aim of Chomsky's theory is to achieve "explanatory adequacy," meaning it must explain how a child could possibly acquire the complex system of a natural language.
6. **Resistance to "Teleo-tyranny"**: Chomsky resists explanations of linguistic phenomena solely in "teleological" or functional terms (e.g., communicative purposes), suggesting that the underlying grammar may simply be an "odd, intricate machine in our brains" that operates according to its own principles, independent of its use.

### Intentionality: Definition and Its Challenges

Intentionality, in the philosophy of mind, refers to the fundamental property of mental states to be "directed toward" or "about" something. This "aboutness" is a distinctive feature of the mental, as argued by Franz Brentano. Intentional states can be about real or unreal objects (e.g., chairs, ghosts, Zeus).

However, intentionality has faced substantial skepticism in 20th-century philosophy and science due to its perceived "obscurity" and the difficulty of "reducing" it to non-intentional physical phenomena. Many scientifically-minded thinkers have excluded it from serious scientific inquiry.

### Chomsky's Shifting Stance on Intentionality

Interestingly, Chomsky's relationship with intentionality is complex and appears to have evolved:

1. **Apparent Intentionalism**: In his earlier and even some later meta-theoretic writings, Chomsky often uses intentionalist vocabulary. He speaks of "representing input signals," "representing the structural information," and "mental representations". His 1965 "Aspects" model of language acquisition, describing children forming and evaluating hypotheses, appears to portray language learning as a "rational achievement" with clear intentionalist implications.
2. **Explicit Anti-Intentionalism**: Since the mid-1980s, Chomsky has explicitly denied a role for intentionality in serious science, stating that "intentional attribution... is not likely to provide explanatory theory or to be integrated into the natural sciences". He seems concerned that the phrase "representation of x" implies an external 'x' that is being represented, which he believes does not apply to the abstract linguistic entities (like words, phrases, sentences, or Structural Linguistic Entities, SLEs) that his theory is about. For Chomsky, if there are no external SLEs, and intentional representations require them, then intentional representations have no place in linguistics. He also expresses skepticism about computer models if they rely on "designer's intent" or "mode of interpretation".
3. **Methodological Dualism**: Rey points out the irony that Chomsky, who strongly "deplores" methodological dualism (treating the mind differently from the rest of nature), seems to embrace its motivation by dismissing intentionality from natural science.

### Reconciling the Views: The Debate

The apparent contradiction in Chomsky's stance has led to different interpretations:

1. **Collins' Abstract-Algebraic Reading**: John Collins, a prominent interpreter of Chomsky, argues that Chomsky's intentionalist language (e.g., "hypothesis testing") should be understood as a "trope or metaphor". Collins suggests that Chomsky's core interest is in the formal and structural features of competence, which can be captured without recourse to problematic intentional notions. For Collins, the "theory-talk" merely highlights the internal structure that behaviorist accounts miss.
2. **Rey's Defense of Intentionality**: Georges Rey, in his book "Representation of Language," challenges Chomsky's anti-intentionalist claims, arguing that intentionality is, in fact, crucial for Chomskyan linguistics to achieve explanatory adequacy.
    - **The "Scandal" of SLEs**: Rey contends that it is a "scandal" that linguists haven't sufficiently "pondered what exactly SLEs are". He argues that these abstract linguistic entities (like phonemes, words, phrases, sentences) are best understood as "intentional inexistents" â€“ "objects" of mental representations that may not be real or instantiated in the external world. This allows for representations to be "of" something without requiring an external physical referent, addressing Chomsky's concern about "representation of x".
    - **Explanatory Role in Acquisition**: Rey argues that for a child to acquire language, their perceptual system must be "sensitive to grammatical phenomena" and engage in "probabilistic reasoning". This process, from sensory input to grammatical intake, requires "computations being defined on intentionalistic representations of the linguistic categories". Without intentional content, it's hard to see how the grammar and the parser, though distinct, could "communicate with each other, sharing, as it were, a common coin".
    - **BasicAsymmetries**: Rey proposes "BasicAsymmetries" as a modest approach to define intentional content, which can account for how a physical system can be sensitive to "abstruse" properties (like "being a noun" or "being a verb") that are not local, physical, or always instantiated. This allows intentionality to play an "essential explanatory role" without demanding a full "reduction" to physical terms.
    - **"Cognize" and Epistemology**: Chomsky's technical term "cognize" (to know implicitly) and his focus on "explanatory epistemology" (explaining cognitive capacities) rather than "working epistemology" (how we consciously know) align with the idea of largely non-conceptual intentional states necessary for language acquisition.

In essence, while Chomsky has sought to distance his linguistic theory from intentionality, particularly concerning external reference, Rey argues that some form of intentionality is indispensable for explaining how humans acquire and process language, especially when dealing with the abstract and sometimes non-existent "objects" of linguistic theory like grammatical categories themselves. The debate highlights the ongoing philosophical challenges in integrating our understanding of the mind and language into a coherent scientific framework.
